* **Step 10:** After editing your video, you can hit the ‘export’ button to save the new changes you made. You can save in a different resolution, format, or bitrate. You can also choose to export directly to a video-sharing platform.

**Final Thoughts**

The cost of a music video can vary due to different factors. Production costs like the length, concept, location, and the actions you would like to take in the video can significantly change the cost. Additionally, you have to factor in the extra costs like crew, casts, transportation, feeding, etc. However, if you want a music video professionally edited from start to finish, Wondershare Filmora doesn’t just help you cut costs; it also ensures you get an enhanced music video result at the end.
