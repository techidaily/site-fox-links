### 3\. Keyframing  

Here’s another wonderful feature of Filmora 11 which is the Keyframing. It is a really powerful feature that allows you to custom animate, the scale position and opacity of your clips. If you are not familiar with keyframing, this article is for you!  
I would show you how to keyframe your video in a simple way.  
Let’s get started!

* Start by adding a video clip to your timeline.
* Double-click on the clip to open up the **edit menu**.
* Go to the **animation tab** from the menu at the top and select **customize tab**.
* Click on the **Add button** to create a keyframe.
* To create movement, we need to move the play head at the end of the clip to create a second keyframe.
* Now change the scale and adjust the position to fix any framing issues.  
![keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/keyframe.png)  
See how good it looks!  

### 4\. Speed Ramping  

Let us learn about speed ramping. With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience and then speed it up with action. Make sure to adjust your camera at a higher frame rate to film a slow-motion video.  
Let’s get started…

* Import the clip into Filmora
* Drag the clip and drop it into the timeline.
* Right-click on the clip and select the **speed** in the menu and choose **speed ramping** to open the settings window.  
![speed ramping0](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/speed-ramping0.png)  
Here you will find different speed templates in the settings window.  
  * You can also choose to customize and adjust the keyframe and adjust the speed you want for your video.  
  * The lower keyframe graph shows the video is **slow** and the peak shows the video is **fast**.  
  * Move the keyframe up to increase the speed of the video and move it down to decrease the speed of the video.  
  * You can add more speed effects at the point you want by adding a **+** sign.
