## Part 4\. How to Add Free Animation to Video on Mobile

Making films with animated text is a breeze with Textro, a video editing program that enables you to add text and add animated text effects like shadow, light, reflection, etc. to your texts. Your videos will appear polished in no time! You may make a fantastic film with mixed media material by using the program, which also permits adding photographs, videos, and other images to your video.

Utilizing Textro is quite easy. All you have to do is choose the items you want to include in your movie in the correct sequence, then add a title to the finished product. You share the trend of editors using increasingly inventive methods to add motion text to their work, whether it be on YouTube channels or in Hollywood films. Following that, you may choose a broad topic for your video, which will also contain an introduction. Whatever the case, you may, of course, edit your material more thoroughly if you so want.

##### Step1 Download the App

To get started, just download the app. It will ask you to add text when you first run the software.

##### Step2 Add Text and Customize

By clicking the random button, you may create an entirely new color combination or change the color scheme of the post using the options that are currently available.

##### Step3 Add Animated Template and Customize

From the list of templates in both Fonts and Colors tab, select the best suited one and add it to the text. In this way, you can add text adjustments while customizations hand in hand.
