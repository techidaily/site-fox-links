## Elite Selection - 6 Unmatched Tools for Pristine Signature Edits

Working remotely has had its advantages. However, one crucial problem is signatures. We work with them a lot, but most of us don't know how to remove a signature's background when it's really urgent.

That's not going to be a problem for you any longer. This guide will show you how to use Microsoft Word, **as well as 5 other online tools**, to easily remove the background of any signature.

## Using Microsoft Word as a Fast Signature Background Remover

Microsoft Word is one of the best options. Most of us already have it installed on our computers anyway.

Just follow these three simple steps and you'll be done in no time.

##### Step1Insert the Image Into Word

The first step is simple. Open up Microsoft Word, click on **Insert** from the upper-left panel, and select the image from your computer.

##### Step1Remove the Background

This step is where most of the work is done.

First, click on the image so it's highlighted. Then, go to the menu at the top and hit **Format.** Look to the upper-left corner and click on **Corrections.** Then, set the parameters exactly as in this image. 馃憞

##### Step3Crop the Image and Save It

Lastly, you should crop out the white spaces near the corners of the signature image. Just select the image and click on **Crop** from the upper-right corner of the screen. Use the black lines around it to crop it.

Then, from the Format menu at the top, click on **Compress Pictures.**

After this, make sure to select the settings as follows:

![word compress pictures settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/compress-picture-settings.png)

The only thing that's left to do now is to save the image. Right-click on the signature and select **Save as Picture.** Then, save it on your computer as a PNG, and you're finally done.

## 5 Best Signature Background Remover Online in 2022

### Canva

Canva is among the most used online image editing tools on the planet. It features an incredibly stable performance and includes a few tools that rival Photoshop. Its signature background remover will get the job done in seconds. The app is free, but the signature background removal tool inside isn't.

##### How to Use Canva to Remove Signature's Background?

It's simple. Go to [Canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) and follow these steps.

1. Create an account and sign up for the Canva Pro free trial
2. Then, click on **Create a Design**

![create a design on canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/canva-design.png)

1. Choose a suggested resolution template or input a custom size

![choose custom size canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/canva-size.png)

1. Select your image, click on **Edit Image** and use the **Background Remover Tool**

![remove signature background canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/canva-background-remover.png)

1. Finally, export the image with a transparent background. This ensures you can use the signature without a background anywhere you want.

![download transparent background canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/canva-download.png)

##### Canva Pros & Cons

 Pros

* Highly reliable and effective
* Very easy to use
* Available on all platforms and devices
* You can use this tool free for a full month on free trial
* Offers a massive list of extra editing features

 Cons

* The signature background remover online tool is not included with the free plan

### Clipping Magic

Compared to Canva, [Clipping Magic](https://clippingmagic.com/) is twice as fast and simple. That's because Clipping Magic is designed solely for this purpose — removing backgrounds from all sorts of images. This tool is effective but it's not free. Their pricing plans range from $2/mo to $11/mo.

##### How to Use Clipping Magic for Signature Background Removal?

It will take you no longer than a minute to remove the background of any signature. Here's how:

1. Go to [ClippingMagic.com](https://clippingmagic.com/) and upload your signature image

![clipping magic homepage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clipping-magic.png)

1. Wait a few seconds and click **Download** when it's done

![clipping magic signature remover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clipping-magic-download.png)

##### Clipping Magic Pros & Cons

 Pros

* It's a one-click platform that quickly removes backgrounds from signatures
* There is no complex editing required
* It allows you to change some image settings and effects if you really want to
* It has an extremely high effectiveness rate, meaning it rarely does a poor job

 Cons

* The free plan only lets you download a tiny version of the image that's not really usable most of the time

### Adobe Photoshop Express

You can use the basic image editor from Adobe Photoshop Express for free. Luckily, its signature background remover falls under this category. However, if you want to add further customization to any other images, it requires one of their paid pricing models.

##### How to Use Adobe Photoshop Express?

First, go to the [Free Transparent Background Maker](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/transparent-background) tool this software offers.

Next, click on **Upload Your Photo.** This will take you to a new page where you can browse your images.

![free transparent background maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adobe-photoshop-express.png)

Once you upload your image, it will start removing the background by itself. Once it's done, you can choose to customize it or download it. Since this is a signature background removal, you don't really need to customize anything.

Click on **Download** and you're all done.

![remove background adobe photoshop express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/adobe-download.png)

### Remove.bg

[Remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) is a website that strictly offers to remove backgrounds from images. There's nothing more, nothing less. That's it. There's only one button. You click it and the background of your signature is removed. Best of all, it's completely free.

##### How to Use Remove.bg

Once you go to [Remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/), you will see a blue button. Press it.

![remove image background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/remove-bg.png)

After this, select the image you want to use. It will remove it in less than 2 seconds. Once it's done, click on **Download**, and that's it.

It instantly downloads the image without asking you for donations or to sign up and create an account. Trust me when I saw — this is as simple as it gets.

##### Remove.bg Pros & Cons

 Pros

* One-click instant background removal
* It is completely free
* Doesn't require creating an account
* Great quality downloads
* Very fast processing time

 Cons

* HD images aren't free. But, the quality for the free signature images is still great
* No additional editing features

### Pixlr

Pixlr offers a bit more than just removing the background of signatures. It's actually an online photo editor. While using it for removing backgrounds is perfectly fine, you can always get a lot more out of this tool if you want.

##### How to Use Pixlr as a Signature Background Remover?

Don't open the Pixlr image editor if you simply want to remove the background of your signature. Instead, you need to access the [Pixlr background remover](https://pixlr.com/remove-background/). Here, all it takes is a few simple clicks to get the job done.

![pixlr background remover](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/pixlr-background-remover.png)

Click on the "+", select your photo, and click **Save.**

If you want, you can edit in bulk as well. It will download all the signatures as a Zip file which you then have to extract on your computer.

##### Pixlr Pros & Cons

 Pros

* Very simple and easy to use
* It's totally free
* It lets you choose different colored backgrounds if you don't want transparent
* It's great for bulk background removals

 Cons

* It takes a while to process the image. It's especially long if you're processing more signatures in bulk
* It's not always 100% accurate
* If you want to fine-tune the background removal, you need to pay for premium

## Conclusion

We all know the hassle of not having a good signature image when it's really urgent. Fortunately, now you know how to remove signature's background in just a few seconds. So, whenever the need comes up again, you'll be ready.
