### 4\. Taskbar and Start Menu Placements

The biggest Windows 11 tip and trick is the placement of Taskbar and Start Menu. Windows 11 has a taskbar and start menu in the center.

The updated technology allows you to have better control over the privacy of your data and device from personalized ads.

### 7\. Widgets and Chat Customization

Using Widgets and Chats helps the user have a quick chat with people that they love the most. Widget and Chats are the two new features introduced in Windows 11.

However, some people do not like using this kind of stuff. They don’t even prefer crowding their taskbar. For such cases, you can turn them off from the toggle switches that are available in the ‘Show or Hide the buttons that appear on Taskbar' or 'Taskbar Items. '

![disable widgets and other items](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/windows-11-secret-tips-and-tricks-7.jpg)

For changing your default location, hit the ‘Set Default’ button on the right side of the screen. This will open the Map. Now, enter the location that you want to have, and lastly, click on the ‘Change’ button in the top left corner.
