### Transfer files with Airdrop

How to send large video files from iPhone using Airdrop? This application’s use is only possible when the person who wishes to send the file or video is near you.

Airdrop uses low energy Bluetooth 4.0 to negotiate, discover, and broadcast connections. The Wi-Fi point to point transfer makes the Airdrop sharing faster, secure, and power-efficient.

Airdrop can share almost everything like photos, passbook passes, videos, contacts, map location, voice memos and whatever you can see on the share sheet.

Few points to note are, you may choose to Airdrop between your contacts or for all. If a person is in your contact, both must be logged into iCloud and if you send it to any random person, you might get prank airdrops.

If the person you wish to send long videos from iPhone has made the Airdrop receiving setting to Contact and you are not in that person’s contact list, make him change the receiving settings to Everyone. Personal hotspot must be turned off and check if the Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi are turned on.
