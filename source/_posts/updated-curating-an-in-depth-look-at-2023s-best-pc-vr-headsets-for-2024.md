### [META 2](https://www.metavision.com/)

It is a very pricey product.

### [Avegant Glyph](https://www.avegant.com/)

The design of Glyph is very interesting and beautiful. With audio centric design, it can be worn like headphones. The vision is in front of your eyes. Each eye catches 1280 x 720 display.
