Step 1: Reveal Markup Toolbar

Right-click the photo you want to edit on Mac, go to **Open With**, and click **Preview (default)**. Next, click the **Show Markup Toolbar** from the upper-right corner of the interface to get the **Markup Toolbar** under the standard toolbar.

Step 2: Use the Shapes Tool

Next, click the **Border Color** and **Fill Color** icons and select your preferred colors for the shape’s outline and background color.

Step 3: Use the Text Tool

Click the **Text** tool from the **Markup Toolbar**, drag the text frame to your preferred location on the image, and use the scaling handles to resize the frame.
