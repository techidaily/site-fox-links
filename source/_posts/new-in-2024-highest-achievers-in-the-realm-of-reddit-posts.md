## 10 Most Upvoted Reddit Posts of All Time

### 1\. The Senate (/r/movies)

![chancellor palpatine the senate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/the-senate.png)

When writing the article (Nov., 2022), this Reddit post features over 400k votes. 97% of those users Upvoted. This percentage made it the most upvoted Reddit post until another overtook it.

(r/wallstreetbets)

![times square billboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/times-square-billboard.png)

Its purpose is quite ironic. The point was to make this image of Chancellor Palpatine from Star Wars the first result on Google whenever someone searched for "The Senate."

Sadly, the attempt failed but still received a lot of attention.

### 2\. $GME GO BRRR (r/wallstreetbets)

This post currently has 469k votes with a stunning 99% Upvote rate. It’s now the most upvoted Reddit post in this list.

It represents a fun and public meme of someone buying a billboard in New York. The content of the billboard: $GME GO BRR.

$GME stands for GameStop's stock name. BRR represents printing money. The idea behind it - publicly displaying the astonishing soar of GameStop's stock at that time.

### 3\. Rick Astley Rides a Bike (r/pics)

![rick astley rides a bike](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rick-astley-old-photo.png)

Posted in 2020, this one currently has 438k votes with 99% Upvotes. It was posted by a famous user known on Reddit as [/u/ReallyRickAstley](https://www.reddit.com/user/ReallyRickAstley/).

If you know the famous song "Never Gonna Give You Up, " you know who this is. Well, this is the Reddit account of the artist Rick Astley himself, taking over the platform with a photo of himself he found in 1989.

### 4\. NYC Taxi Drivers Calendar (/r/funny)

![nyc taxi driver calendar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/new-york-taxi-driver.png)

Another funny post in the official /r/funny subreddit itself. At this time, this one has 308k votes, 97% of which are Upvotes.

The image depicts the New York spirit as an excited cab driver shows off his cab in the 2018 New York Taxi Driver calendar.

What's even more interesting is that the driver commented on this Reddit post, letting everyone know that he also got the title "Mr. December" that year.

### 5\. Showing a Game You Mastered to Someone You Care About (/r/gaming)

![showing a game you mastered reddit post](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/angry-gamer.png)

Reddit gets most of its users inside its gaming communities. As a result, these can be some of the hottest topics with countless popular posts.

This one, for example, features 269k votes. 98% of them Upvoted, all probably enthusiastic gamers themselves.

The image shows an experienced gamer who spent countless hours beating a game, trying to teach a friend how to play it.

You understand the pain if you've gone through something like this.

### 6\. All News Anchors Say the Same Thing(/r/videos)

![all news anchors say the same thing reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/news-anchors.png)

293k users voted on this post, revealing what it looks like when a single company owns dozens of local news stations.

The phrase "this is extremely dangerous to our democracy" is repeated repeatedly in every news broadcast from these news stations.

97% of these 293k users upvoted and agreed that all news anchors say the same thing.

### 7\. Thirsty Frog Takes a Bath (r/aww)

![thirsty frog takes a bath reddit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/frog-taking-a-bath.png)

Some things on Reddit don't have to make sense to get a lot of attention.

Like this frog, for example. 99% out of the 313k voters on this post upvoted and loved watching this tiny frog take a bath on a hot summer day.

That's all there is to it. No politics, no serious issues, and so on. Just a frog trying to cool off in a bottle cup.

### 8\. Battle for Net Neutrality (/r/books)

![battle for net neutrality reddit post](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/battle-for-net-neutrality.png)

This is another most upvoted Reddit post that encouraged over 180k users to join the battle for net neutrality. Again, 86% of these users are upvoters who agree with the statements in the post.

It's a post with a title and a link to a site where anyone can join the battle. The goal - prevent Internet Service Providers from blocking apps and websites.

### 9\. Deangelo Juggles Balls for Real(/r/DunderMifflin)

![reddit post of deangelo juggling balls the office](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deangelo-juggling-balls-on-the-office.png)

Millions of fans worldwide loved The Office with Steve Carell, a.k.a Michael Scott. One of the funniest moments was when Will Ferrell juggled imaginary balls in the Dunder Mifflin office.

Well, a Reddit user made an edit of this clip and now it looks as if Will juggled four balls... then five.

The post has a 98% upvote rate with 170k voters in total. The reason it's so popular is that The Office fans can't get enough of this show. Many say they never stop watching short clips of the show on Youtube and Reddit after finishing the entire series.

### 10\. Brave Soldier Buried Amongst His Devoted Troops (/r/todayilearned)

![reddit post of soldier and his fathers message](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/brave-soldier-buried-with-his-devoted-troops-reddit.png)

Finally, this is an inspiring and heartwarming post about a brave troop.

At this time, the post has 155k votes of which 93% are upvotes. Readers love the post because it shows a true story during a war. None of us can resist such tales.

The troop is known as Col. Shaw. The confederates buried this man in a mass grave, trying to insult him for leading black soldiers.

After an attempt by Union Troops to recover his body, they received a letter from Col' Shaw's father, saying, "_We would not have his body removed from where it lies surrounded by his brave and devoted soldiers._"

The Reddit post has over 4k comments, many of which feature thousands of upvotes.
