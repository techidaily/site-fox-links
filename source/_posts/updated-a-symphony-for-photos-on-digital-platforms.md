You can also add effects to the audio using Filmora. There are five main effects that you can produce. They are Echo, Lobby, large room, small room, and phone. You can access them from the “Effects” tab. Just scroll to the audio effects sub-category and you’re good to go.

**Step 5:** Export Finished File

You can edit the images and audio until it suits your needs. You can then export the file as an mp4\. Filmora also offers a range of outputs like avi, webm, mov, f4v, mkv, and more. If you're targeting the output for a device like mobile-friendly or desktop friendly, you can change the settings accordingly.
