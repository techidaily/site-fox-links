#### 7. [Alamoon Watermark](https://alamoon.com/watermark-editor.html)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

This editor supports a broad range of photo file formats and it is capable of processing thousands of images in just a couple of minutes.

The batch processing features, however, remain one of the most common reasons why professional photographers opt to use the Star Watermark software.

#### 9. [Visual Watermark](https://www.visualwatermark.com/)

#### 10. [Water Marquee](https://www.watermarquee.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This online watermarking tool enables you to create your own watermarks or use fully customizable templates to protect your images.
