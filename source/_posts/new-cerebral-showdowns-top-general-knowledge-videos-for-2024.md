With Filmora, you can easily add quizzes, graphics, and effects to your video. The software can also record your voiceover or add background music.

Here's how you can make a **general knowledge quiz video** on your own using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

##### Step2 Make An Intro

In the next step, start by creating an intro. To do so, open the **"Media"** tab, select a template, and drop it in the timeline once it is downloaded.
