This section explains two primary subjects: how the scenario is presented and what happens there (the character's actions). When writing this part, keep the following things in mind. Well first, dialogue cannot directly follow a slug line; instead, there are usually scenes and descriptions of action. Second, because the screenplay is not a novel, psychological or other non-visual descriptions must be avoided to convey what the "audience" can see. Rather than, you should simply describe the emotional shifts in the character, giving the actor some leeway to perform naturally.

1. **Time**

The determination of time is also a basic format. For example, DAY, NIGHT, etc. Generally, all of them are followed by a "-".

### **Parenthetical**

We use Parenthetical in a screenplay by placing the brackets. It can be used directly under the name of the specific character before speaking the indicating sentences and to make an alert voice for the scene.

## Part 3\. Make your script come true using Filmora

If your movie script is completely finished and you have shot the various parts of the video clip, all you need to do now is to open [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and put your inspired pieces together into a wonderful movie. The regular video editing processes won't be covered in length here. Next, I will show you what changes Filmora can bring to your movie videos.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### ** Color Correction

It's common to describe a video as having a cinematic sense and aesthetic, which is mostly based on the overall color tone of the video. However, expert-level custom color matching demands not only your expertise but also your own color sensitivity, therefore it is not recommended for all beginners. With the help of a range of in-app preset LUTs, you can simply alter the color of your films and give them a more cinematic feel using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### ** Preset Templates

Using some templates will greatly increase your productivity if you're trying to create a short film with a more conventional subject matter. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has template designs for a range of subjects, including Game, YouTube, Camping and Sport. Simply drag the chosen template into your timeline and edit the text to fit the theme. In this method, a video with a lot of details can be produced rapidly! Additionally, you can make your own templates to share to others who are more creative.

## Conclusion

The Slug Line is a great method and an important element to use to enhance your script. It helps to determine the precise actions, adjustments, and changes in backgrounds, scenes, and transitions that are required. I hope you don't have any questions about slug lines or how to use them after reading this post. Moreover, you can turn your script into a fantastic video using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Gratitude for reading.
