When this sensor is not in use then it automatically swings back to its normal position. As this monitor is designed with very slick design so it would be quite difficult to use any calibration instrument over it. Thus automated adjustments suit it better.

 Users can set schedules calibration timings for this monitor and when that schedule needs to run then your standby monitor will wake up automatically and it will spend few minutes for automatic calibration. Once this task is completed then it normally goes back to sleep mode.

The build in sensor ensures perfect optimization for calibrated screen. You will find its Color Edge Navigator Software tool easy to setup and it can assist users for their video and photography needs.
