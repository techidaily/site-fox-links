## Part 1: How to Record Slow Motion Video on iPhone

Slow-motion video, a feature that is offered only by the high-end expensive cameras is now available with the iPhone 5s and later models. It is easy to use, affordable, and sheer fun. Here are the steps to record iPhone slow-motion videos.

* Click on the Camera app to open it
* At the bottom of the screen, you can find some text like: PHOTO, SQUARE, PANO etc
* Swipe to right and you will see SLO-MO out
* Start recording your slow motion video by tapping the red colored record button ![slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-slow-motion.JPG)

* Again tap the record button to stop the iPhone slow motion video recording
* Once you stop recording, the recorded slow-mo clip will be saved in the Photos app. You can now set up which part in the clip should be in normal speed and which part of the video should keep the slow-motion settings.

![find recorded slow motion videos in iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-all-recorded-slow-motion-videos-iphone.jpg)

* Check the edited playback by tapping the blue button at the bottom of the screen ![edit recorded slow motion video on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-recorded-slow-motion-video-on-iphone.jpg)

### Some Important Facts to Know about Shooting Slow Motion Video in iPhone

**Capture Screenshot** \- You can capture stills while shooting iPhone slow motion videos. Tap on the white button at the left bottom corner of the screen and a high resolution snapshot is automatically saved in the Camera Roll folder beside the recorded video.

![capture still image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/still-camera.JPG)

**Supported Slow** \- Mo Shooting Modes- Do you know the slow motion recording modes supported by iPhone?

iPhone 5s only can capture 720p at 120 FPS. iPhone 6/6 Plus/6s/6s Plus, iPhone 7/7 Plus can capture 720p at 240 FPS. iPhone 8/8 Plus and iPhone X can even capture 1080p HD at 240 FPS.

**Space used by slo-mo video** \- It is vital to know that the iPhone 5s onwards iOS devices record slow motion video at 120 frames per second (fps). If you record slow motion video at higher frame rates, it takes lesser space than 120fps video.

The slo-mo video recorded at 1080p resolution at 120 fps uses approximately 375 MB per minute storage space and slow motion video iPhone resolution of 720p at 240 fps uses approximately 300 MB per minute.

**Is slow motion video from normal video possible** \- A higher frame rate than normal is required to record a slow motion video., Playing a slow motion video to normal is possible but the reverse is impossible. You get a jerky video with frames jumping here and there when you try to watch a slow motion video from normal. It appears as a series of still snapshots rather than a constant video.

## Part 2: How to Change Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion

If you’ve recorded a video on iPhone in normal speed and want to turn it into a slow-motion video, or if you can’t record a slow-motion video with your iPhone, you can use some third-party apps to convert them to slow motion videos. Here, we can recommend some [video speed changing apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for turning normal speed video into slow-motion videos.

You can slow the video by 25%, 40%, or 50%.

Once all set, tap Render and select the Optical Flow to get the best parameters. Finally, save So if you liked SloPro, get the full version within the app.the video and share it with your friends on Facebook and YouTube.
