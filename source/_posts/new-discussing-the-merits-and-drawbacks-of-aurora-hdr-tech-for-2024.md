As High Dynamic Range shots and images become more common, Adobe adapted to the change. As of 2020, Adobe allows its users to import, edit and export HLG content. HLG format bundles the SDR and HDR color spaces into one stream of information. Now, users can edit HDR footage without any difficulty.

One more advantage of Adobe Premiere is that it supports both operating systems, i.e., Mac as well as Windows.

**Best For:**

Adobe Premiere is the most common software used for video editing. Hollywood video makers tend to use it to create cinema-worthy films by transforming raw footage into exquisite video products. So, unleash your creativity and create magic!

**Ratings:**

Adobe has an average of 4.5-star ratings out of 5.
