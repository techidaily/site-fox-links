## Effortless Selection of Personal Ending Music Samples

An outro video is as important as an intro video in videography and filmmaking. A video summary is an outro: you may see a video outro as the conclusion at the end of an article. Thus, your outro must be concise, captivating, and easy to digest. Outro templates are ready-made short videos, either editable or not editable**. Free outro templates** give you access to quality videography content, especially high-resolution outro template makers. Most outro template makers require basic design knowledge or give you all access to ready-made content: outro template for free download. Learn more about individual **video outro templates** below.

## Part 1: Editable free video outro templates

Editable video outro templates provide a corresponding editor or webpage where you edit templates. Customization is important in video creation, and editable video outro templates give online tools to customize your video content. Some of the software give copyright-free content: without a watermark in the best resolution.

1. [**Filmstock**](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/)

For example, you may use the video files directly or combine them with other videos/pictures to create an outro video. The beautiful thing is that you can combine, edit, and download them at their best resolution.

Filmstock editing comes in two asset types: Filmora Effects and After Effects. The two effects are suitable for everyday use, although you have to learn the basics of Filmora effects. Unlike After effects, the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) editor provides an editing theme: you can make several outro videos with a single theme by changing some variations.
