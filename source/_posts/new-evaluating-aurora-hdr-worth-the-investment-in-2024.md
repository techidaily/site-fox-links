Adobe Premiere is another alternative for Aurora. Adobe is basically a video editing software that offers a variety of features to help you create amazing videos from scratch or edit your prerecorded videos. Some of the main features that Adobe offers are automated editing tools such as auto reframing, quick mode, step-by-step guided edits, sharing with ease, different libraries, and much more. However, among its vast list of features also lies the HDR feature.

As High Dynamic Range shots and images become more common, Adobe adapted to the change. As of 2020, Adobe allows its users to import, edit and export HLG content. HLG format bundles the SDR and HDR color spaces into one stream of information. Now, users can edit HDR footage without any difficulty.

One more advantage of Adobe Premiere is that it supports both operating systems, i.e., Mac as well as Windows.

**Best For:**

Adobe Premiere is the most common software used for video editing. Hollywood video makers tend to use it to create cinema-worthy films by transforming raw footage into exquisite video products. So, unleash your creativity and create magic!

**Ratings:**

Adobe has an average of 4.5-star ratings out of 5.
