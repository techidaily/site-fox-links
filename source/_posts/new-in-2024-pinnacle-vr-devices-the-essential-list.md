This machine provides you a feeling of flying around in the town like a giant bird once you have strapped it around you, which gives a very beautiful experience. There are not many games in which you can use it, but it is very worthy to try it out once at least. This is not a kind of setup you could have at your home, but it is displayed at exhibitions and other such events.
