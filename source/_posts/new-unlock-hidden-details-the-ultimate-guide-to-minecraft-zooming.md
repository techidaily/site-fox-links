You may perform zoom in Minecraft windows 10 by using the following instructions to zoom in. But if this option is there in the version you're using, it will often be found in the "Options" or "Settings" menu, tucked away in the "Video" sub-menu (or the platform equivalent). A slider or other method of changing the value will be included.

Since its first release in 2011, this amazing game has gained an estimated 126 million active players. Many members of the Minecraft gaming community have recently expressed a desire to learn how to zoom in Minecraft launcher. You must crush the item in order to create the intricate parts.

You may want to zoom in on certain areas to utilize blocks and tools more effectively since it entails destroying things and making even more complicated products. If you have the same questions, relax; here is all you need to know to zoom in on Minecraft.

## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

![minecraft game menu options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-game-menu-options.jpg)

Step3 Now, use the slider to alter your range of vision. The slider will be positioned in the center by default. To get a closer look at your surroundings, click on it and move it to the left of your screen. However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.

![minecraft fov button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-fov-button.jpg)

Step4 To save the new FOV settings after finishing adjusting the slider and being satisfied with the field of vision, click Done at the bottom of the page.

Step5 Now, after the successful zoom in on Minecraft, press Backspace to get into the menu and to continue playing, choose "Return to Game."

## Way 2\. Change FOV in Options

You may utilize the accessibility features in mac OS to get a zooming option while altering your FOV. You may reach the Minecraft window by manually adjusting the zoom in and out.
