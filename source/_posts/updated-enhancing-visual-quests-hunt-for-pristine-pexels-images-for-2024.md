![negative space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/cool-photos-download-pexels-2.jpg)

Another top keyword to get cool background images for websites on pexels.com is negative space. Using the keyword allows you access to various stock images featuring all subjects such as human faces, abstract photos, and nature.

Stock photos with negative space are popular because they offer the freedom to input your text messages without adding too much noise to the image.

### 3\. Cultural diversity

![cultural diversity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/cool-photos-download-pexels-3.jpg)

How do you make your commercial messages more appealing? First, try using stock photos that represent diversity. For example, you can include blended families or images that show gender equality. In addition, cool photos on pexels.com that feature subjects from different races are the most popular.

Organizations that cater to multiple audiences are the main users of these images since they make the messaging more relatable.

### 4\. Flat lay

![flat lay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/cool-photos-download-pexels-4.jpg)

Are you familiar with flat lay stock images? These are images where you shoot your subjects from a bird’s eye view. In addition, your subjects need to be in a systematic order to prevent any confusion in your target audience. For example, you can arrange your photography equipment on a table to show the diversity required to shoot photographs.

Typically, cool photos on pexels.com under the flat lay keyword feature inanimate subjects such as food and equipment. Furthermore, flat lay stock photos are the best choice for social media posts on Twitter and Instagram. This is because they do not require much editing if taken correctly.

### 5\. Retro

Feeling nostalgic, you can also get some cool photos on pexels.com using the retro keyword. Typically, these stock photos feature green and orange as the lead colors, with patterns and hard lighting combined to enhance the imagery further.

Most retro stock photographs feature a 70 or 80s look, which best articulates the hard light and bold color schemes. In addition, you will find these images featured in ad campaigns depicting food, home décor, and fashion, where you need to focus more on the subject details.

## Part 2: Search for collections

Using keywords to find cool background images for websites on pexels.com also gives you access to different collections. The platform uses bubble tabs to present you with related photos to your primary keyword. However, these are not ways to refine your results. Instead, they give you alternatives to other stock photos that you can use to spread your message. Here is more information on collections of cool photos on pexels.com.

### 1\. What is a collection on Pexels.com?

In addition, collections are often attributed to a single verified user of pexels.com. Therefore, you need to register an account before accessing the photos.
