### 4\. Boost social media engagement

The fact that SRT is highly compatible with almost every platform makes it a good subtitle file format. Yes, SRT can be used on different platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and many other native video platforms. And as stated earlier, you don't need to always edit it or generate additional files irrespective of the platform you're looking to use it on.

### 5\. Improve SEO ability

As stated earlier, due to the fact SRT files can be indexed and crawled by Google, it helps improve their video SEO. When a user searches a particular keyword online, the keywords in the phrases of your subtitles will be analyzed by Google, and if it matches, it'll increase the chances of your video being in Google first page.
