If you use Windows, you can use Explorer to look through your storage space and do things like move, rename, open, and even edit files, just like you would on a local drive. Meanwhile, a custom app for Windows, Mac, and Linux goes even further, letting you browse files, preview documents, and stream your media files with a built-in player without having to download it

![flickr illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/flickr.jpg)

Flickr does have a free plan, but users can only post up to 1000 photos. Given that most of us take pictures daily, this doesn't seem like a very generous offer. If you want unlimited storage, you'll need to upgrade to Flickr Pro, which costs money. Therefore, you can subscribe monthly for $8.49 or annually for $80.04\. If you join the annual plan, you gain access to amazing bonuses, such as two free months of Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.

Flickr Pro includes limitless storage space and is compatible with iOS, Android, and PC web browsers. In addition, Flickr permits the upload of JPEG, PNG, and non-animated GIF files but not RAW images, which may be disappointing to professional photographers.

If this limitation does not bother you, Flickr's additional features compensate for it. One of its coolest features is the AutoUploader uploading tool, which allows you to upload a collection of photos from multiple sources. Moreover, Flickr, like many commercial websites, uses SSL/TLS, the small green lock next to a browser's URL address bar, to create a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher AES encryption, making sure that communication between your devices and Flickr is safe.
