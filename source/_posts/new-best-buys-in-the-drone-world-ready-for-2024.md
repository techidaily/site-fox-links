You don't have any smartphone controller, but then again you don't have to register it with the FAA, and that can be very important to keep in mind. It's an extraordinary drone and one that will impress you with its unique features and incredible size. Just consider giving it a shot if you want a quality drone for sale. Overall, at this price you will be more than ok with the features offered by the UDI U81A and it works really well too! Follow this link with top best 10 drones for beginners to find out more!
