### Section 1: What is Gimbal Stabilizer?

 Recently, gimbals have made an impressive entry to the world of videography and today they have become an essential accessory for professionals.

### Section 2: 2 Axis or 3 Axis Gimbal?

 You will generally find two types of gimbals in market: 2-axis and 3-axis. Selection for anyone of these totally depends upon your application. The 2 axis type gimbals have more control over pitch and yaw movements but the 3 axis gimbals extend control to roll movements too along with yaw and pitch adjustments.

 Generally, the 3 axis gimbals are preferred for aerial applications in drones and RC helicopters. They also find applications in applications where camera is to be attached on a car suction mount, camera jib or any remote controlled vehicle. 3 axis gimbals have higher control on camera stabilization.
