## Part 1\. Common Types of Text Animation

Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.

### 1\. Parallax scrolling

Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Fade in and fade out

Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.

### 3\. Sliding text animation

You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.

### 4\. Text breaks away animation

There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations. That text appears on the video and it shatters and disappears. Sometimes, the text turns into dust after shattering like a glass. This text effect cum animation is highly impactful in getting the attention of the viewers immediately.

### 5\. Typing text animation

Referred to as typewriter text animation as well, the characters in a word or sentence appear on the screen one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time. There is always a cursor blinking at the end of the character and it shifts with the appearance of the words and sentences. Instead of showing words or sentences all at once, showing text as if someone is typing it on the screen is more visually pleasing.

### 6\. Horizontal and vertical scrolling text

Last but not least, the vertical scrolling text effect is extremely common for opening and closing credits in movies. This is even used in modern short videos to show credits as well as information as per requirements. Along with vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling text is quite common these days to show a few lines of text instead of showing them together in a paragraph.

## Part 2\. 8 Interesting Text Animation Examples

You should always keep the basic and the common types of text animations in mind and come up with interesting and creative text animations. We are listing down some popular text animation examples that you can use on your video.

### 1\. Morphing Text Animation

When there are multiple words to display one by one, instead of fade in and fade out effect, you can opt for morphing text animation. In this animation, the words seem to get morphed into one another. So, the first word will morph into the second word for the second word to appear on the screen and the sequence continues. The animation can be done fast to showcase multiple words in a short time period.

### 2\. Combined Slide Out Animation

Generally, in a slide out text animation, the text comes out of a border and the animation type remains the same throughout. However, in the modified slide out animation, the text comes out of the border but it can come out of the top, the side, as well as both sides of the border. The border can also animate to move from the side to the top as well as be placed obliquely.

![combined slide out animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/combined-slide-out-animation.jpg)

### 3\. The Stomp Animation

The stomp effect is quite eye-catching due to its dynamic nature. In this animation, the words come out from another word till the entire sentence is displayed. For example, you have a sentence of four words to display. So, you should show the first word and the second word will come out of the first word and the sequence will continue. If you have two words, you can show them coming out of one another from the middle.

### 4\. The Curtain Animation

In this animation, the moving boxes will slide in and slide out and in the process, they will reveal the text hidden behind them. It looks similar to parting the curtain and getting a view. Thereafter, the boxes will slide back in and cover up the text. The sequence will continue to reveal new texts as required.

### 5\. Animated Text Outline Effect

This is one of the stunning After Effects text animation examples whereby the outline of the text is made to animate with different colors so that the text becomes eye-catching. The text fill color should stay the same as the background so that only the outline is visible and the outline will be moving around one another.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. Animated Text Fill Effect

This is one of the most popular GSAP text animation examples whereby you display a sentence with bold style and a color should be moving across the characters in the text. The animated text fill will stay within the characters and should not spill out in the background. The background should be dark for better focus and attention grabbing. Sometimes, people make the color roll from left to right or the text can have a gradient color with the color waving up and down.

### 7\. Neon Light Animation

There are different variations of neon light animation that cool super cool. You can go for the simple neon light animation where the text says still and the neon lights fade in and out. You can change the color of the lights if you plan to keep the text for some time. If you are using a large text, you can go for the modified neon light animation where you can shine in and out for individual characters and the lights could be flickering.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 8\. In and Out of Focus Text Effect

Instead of bringing the entire sentence into focus, you can use a square box to run over the sentence and bring the focus on the words depending on the position of the square box. The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.

### 7\. Neon Light Animation

There are different variations of neon light animation that cool super cool. You can go for the simple neon light animation where the text says still and the neon lights fade in and out. You can change the color of the lights if you plan to keep the text for some time. If you are using a large text, you can go for the modified neon light animation where you can shine in and out for individual characters and the lights could be flickering.

### 8\. In and Out of Focus Text Effect

Instead of bringing the entire sentence into focus, you can use a square box to run over the sentence and bring the focus on the words depending on the position of the square box. The animation is highly effective in getting the viewers to read the sentence and get the message.
