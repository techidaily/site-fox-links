Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.

HDR lab is precisely what the name suggests. It contains all the tools and tutorials needed to start working on HDR images.

**Our Verdict**

However, the website does not have a very intuitive interface, even though it is easy to navigate. The ads that pop up might get frustrating and distracting after a while. Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.

While they all might be sky images, no two images are alike. With varying degrees of colors, locations, and angles, each of them has a separate charm. Also, clouds are probably the highlight of each image, and the coloring makes them look heavenly.

**Our Verdict**
