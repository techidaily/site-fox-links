 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The quality of the images professional and consumer [digital cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can capture has been improving steadily since the turn of the century. Today [cameras that can capture 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or 8K footage have become the industry standard, which is why video editors are in constant need of monitors that can display high-resolution images accurately.

Moreover, programmers, graphic designers, and gamers often need more than what 4K monitors that are currently available on the market can offer. Even though the obvious solution to the shortcomings of 4K monitors lies in getting displays that have higher resolutions, 5K monitors are still not widely accepted by professionals across different industries. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best 5K monitors you can buy.

## What’s 5K Resolution?

Before we take a look at different models of 5K monitors, we are going to take a moment to shed some light on what 5K resolution actually is. The exact resolution of 5K monitors that have 16:9 aspect ratios can vary slightly depending on the model, but the most common 5K resolution is 5120X2880 or 14.7 million pixels.

![5k high resolution ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5k-high-resolution.jpg)

This means that 5K monitors offer 33.33% more pixels on both horizontal and vertical sides than 4K monitors. This extra space can be useful to video editors who want to view 4K footage at native resolution while still being able to see the interface of the app they are using to process it.

As [4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) content is growing more popular, 5K monitors are becoming more useful, which might make them more available on the markets around the globe in the next few years. However, 5K resolution is still not a standard digital cinematography format in 2024, since most video content creators opt to shoot their footage in Full HD or 4K resolution.

This is currently one the least expensive 5K monitor you can find on the market, so if Dell’s or LG’s model are too expensive for you, then Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS may be a good alternative.

Even though Planar is not one of the most recognizable names on the 5K monitor market, its IX2790 model provides excellent performances at a reasonable price. This bezel-free IPS LCD 5K monitor is modernly designed, and it fits perfectly to the office and any other working environment.

The wide horizontal and vertical viewing angle, as well as stunning color accuracy, make Planar IX2790 suitable for use in a broad range of contexts. However, professional video editors, graphic designers, and artists who work with digital images shouldn’t expect high-end performances more expensive 5K monitors can provide.

* Wide horizontal and vertical viewing angle
* Displays colors accurately
* Moderately priced

**Cons**

* Limited connection capabilities
