Finally, in a world where the money-making potential of crypto is soaring, here's a subreddit you can take advantage of.

r/Jobs4Bitcoins offers exactly what the title states - jobs that pay you in Bitcoin instead of good old dollar bills.

Well, payments for the jobs you complete here can also be done in other cryptocurrencies. So, in terms of available tasks, you can find the same jobs as many other subreddits.

The only difference is that the jobs you find here will pay you with crypto. And, if you're lucky, some cryptos have been known to increase greatly in price. So, the more cryptos you collect, the more money you can convert them into. If you're lucky!

A UNIQUE feature of this community is that you can request intermediaries for your transactions. Furthermore, they keep a public list of all their middlemen. So, it's impossible to get scammed.
