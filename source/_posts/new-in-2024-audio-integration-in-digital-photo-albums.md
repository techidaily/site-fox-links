They're also copyright-free music. Some features are applicable not just for audio but also the video you're hoping to create with the sequences of images and music.

**Step 1:** Load Filmora On Your System

You will need to download and install the software on your personal computer or laptop. You can download it on both macOS and Windows.

**Step 2:** Import Your Images

You can click on the "Media" tab to open the file manager. You can also drag and drop your chosen images. Remember to enter them in the sequence you like for the video. If not, you can still rearrange them on the timeline.

**Step 4:** Add Music To Photos

You can go one of two ways with this. One, you can import a file from your computer. Simply click on “import” and browse for the file. Another way is to use audio from Filmora’s royalty free library.

You can also add effects to the audio using Filmora. There are five main effects that you can produce. They are Echo, Lobby, large room, small room, and phone. You can access them from the “Effects” tab. Just scroll to the audio effects sub-category and you’re good to go.

**Step 5:** Export Finished File

You can edit the images and audio until it suits your needs. You can then export the file as an mp4\. Filmora also offers a range of outputs like avi, webm, mov, f4v, mkv, and more. If you're targeting the output for a device like mobile-friendly or desktop friendly, you can change the settings accordingly.
