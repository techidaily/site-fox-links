After launching the application, look for the “Browse” button on the toolbar at the bottom. You may find out what’s hot or featured across several categories. Another option to find a podcast is to type its name into the “search” section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/listen-to-podcasts-on-your-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="search and browse option in apple podcast app"                ></p><p>When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details.

Well, who wouldn’t want to make use of its high quality camera and powerful functionalities to capture the most alluring view! Nevertheless, most of the people fail to take better photos since they don’t know some key photography rules. If you are one of those, all you need to have is little more knowledge on photography composition rules. In today’s post, we have collated 10 golden photography rules that will empower you to steal the view perfectly with your iPhone. So let’s explore and make your photos even more stunning.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Rule-of-Thirds"><a href="#Rule-of-Thirds" class="headerlink" title="Rule of Thirds"></a>Rule of Thirds</h2><p> The Rule of Thirds consists of a set of guidelines to assist a photographer correctly position the subject in a particular scene. It is meant to draw the attention of the viewer directly towards the subject. According to this rule, the picture is divided into nine equal grids that break the entire image with two vertical and two horizontal lines into vertical and horizontal thirds. As per the Rule of Thirds, the subject should be placed at the intersecting points of the grids.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rule-of-third.jpg"                      alt="rule of third"                ></p><h2 id="Leading-Lines"><a href="#Leading-Lines" class="headerlink" title="Leading Lines"></a>Leading Lines</h2><p> Leading lines add depth and scale to an image by leading the eyes into an image. When you want to capture a road running between two rows of trees, a suspended wooden bridge vanishing at a distant point, leading lines make sure that the picture is taken in such a way that the viewer’s eyes would follow your direction (here, the way you guide them along the rows of trees or the bridge vanishing in the horizon). Leading lines create a great impact on the photographs that you click with your iPhone and don’t let the observer wander away from your subject. The leading lines can be diagonal, straight, zigzag, curvy, or radial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leading-lines.jpg"                      alt="leading lines"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Symmetry"><a href="#Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="Symmetry"></a>Symmetry</h2><p> For the perfect photo composition with an iPhone, one should understand what all make for the right composition. Photographers divide the frame they want to click into rough patterns and position the subject at the right place to get wonderful shots. Both man-made and natural symmetry and patterns represent eye-catching compositions. You can either take a shot following the symmetric patterns or break them to make the subject stand out by adding focal points and tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Symmetrical.jpg"                      alt="symmetrical"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Framing"><a href="#Framing" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p> When we see a framed photograph, the frame brings out the beauty of the photograph. There are natural and man-made frames lying around. You just need to find that while clicking a picture. Framing the subject with such frames amplifies focus towards it, by isolating it from the world around. You can capture your subject through a hole, an arch, and different shapes and structures that you can visualize at that time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/framing.jpg"                      alt="framing"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134495/18498" target="_top" id="2134495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134495/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Diagonals"><a href="#Diagonals" class="headerlink" title="Diagonals"></a>Diagonals</h2><p> Diagonals are an integral aspect of photography composition, as they determine the outcome of a picture you have clicked using your iPhone. Let’s get to know what the role of diagonals in a picture is and how it impacts the visual. As you know the Rules of Thirds is important and it positions the subject of interest at a corner over the grid outlay of a photograph. It sometimes might leave the other corner empty and unbalance the image. Using diagonals, you can position the main subject and diagonally move the less important subjects towards the other end to click the perfectly balanced shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/diagonal.jpg"                      alt="diagonal"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151864/7443" target="_top" id="2151864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Shape"><a href="#Shape" class="headerlink" title="Shape"></a>Shape</h2><p> Speaking of shape in photography composition sounds odd? ‘Rule of Thirds’ and ‘Leading Lines’ are not the only rules that make a photo composition. Line, shape, texture, form, space, color, and pattern also play a key role to make your iPhone photography a real treasure. Shape defines the two dimensional view of the subject and the entire scene as well. A well defined subject with a silhouette and backlighting or a black and white picture looks more appealing than a color picture where the shape of the subject or other objects is not prominent. Forms and shapes play an integral role in photography.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shape.jpg"                      alt="shape"                ></p><h2 id="Leave-Empty-Space"><a href="#Leave-Empty-Space" class="headerlink" title="Leave Empty Space"></a>Leave Empty Space</h2><p> You may wonder if I leave too much empty space in my photo contradicts the concept of ‘filling the frame’. But, it brings out the best for your iPhone photography when you have a strong subject in your scene. A clutter free and less distractive environment leads the viewers’ focus towards the main subject. You can think of clicking a giant statue against a clear blue sky, where the sky would act as a perfect background for the statue and render a clean look to the empty space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Space.jpg"                      alt="space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100537/7443" target="_top" id="2100537">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100537" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100537/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Direction-of-Subject"><a href="#The-Direction-of-Subject" class="headerlink" title="The Direction of Subject"></a>The Direction of Subject</h2><p> Like all the photography composition rules, it is important to take note of the direction of the subject in a photograph. This is known as the ‘Rule of Space’ and it leads the viewer towards the subject’s direction of motion. For example, if there is a person walking on the road, then there should be space ahead of him. If there is a person sitting in a bench or rock, he should be clicked facing into the frame, and there should be space in front of him. It will help the viewer’s eyes to go along with the direction he is facing and take notice of the other subjects such as, other people walking in front him, or any pet moving around etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/direction.jpg"                      alt="direction"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-Your-Frame"><a href="#Fill-Your-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill Your Frame"></a>Fill Your Frame</h2><p> Making your subject stand out against the entire frame in a photograph creates more impact. You can easily obtain this goal with your iPhone by covering the entire frame with your subject. According to this amazing photography composition technique, all you have to do is move your iPhone closer to the subject and nullify the appearance of the surroundings to take a close shot. Like this, you are able to capture the intricate detailing of a leaf with its vivid colors and texture, the detailing and motif on a wall art and much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fill-the-screen.jpg"                      alt="fill the screen"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123728/7443" target="_top" id="2123728">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123728" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123728/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Break-the-Rules"><a href="#Break-the-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Break the Rules"></a>Break the Rules</h2><p> Lastly, we would say that forget and break all the rules. Make use of the above mentioned rules in photography, but don’t let your heart stick to it. Explore, experiment and let your imaginations fly high to capture whatever you want and however you can that fills your soul. Photography is a passion and you must enjoy it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/break.jpg"                      alt="breal the rules"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclsion"><a href="#Conclsion" class="headerlink" title="Conclsion"></a>Conclsion</h2><p> Next time you are out to shoot something with your iPhone, try these photo composition rules and click mind blowing pictures. Though, these rules help you to get amazing iPhone pictures, learning to find the right subject and clicking with the right photo composition helps you more. With or without the rules, you have to keep a steady hand and a sharp eye for detail with patience if you want to click beautiful photographs with your iPhone.</p><p> Images come from the Internet</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-proven-pathways-to-promoting-in-vr-lands/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Proven Pathways to Promoting in VR Lands</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-filmmaking-foundations-understanding-screenplays/"><u>[New] Filmmaking Foundations Understanding Screenplays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-bsplayer-9-pro-top-choice-for-streaming/"><u>[Updated] BSPlayer 9 Pro Top Choice for Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-eliminate-unwanted-podcast-suggestions-on-spotify-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Eliminate Unwanted Podcast Suggestions on Spotify for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-tap-into-tagging-techniques-for-6kplus-youtube-vistas/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tap Into #Tagging Techniques for $6K+ YouTube Vistas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-innovative-methods-for-chronological-disruption-in-acting-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Innovative Methods for Chronological Disruption in Acting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-analyzing-the-roi-of-sns-hdr-pro-vs-other-hdr-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Analyzing the ROI of SNS HDR Pro Vs.

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint.

There are cases you need to activate speech-to-text in a life event. PowerPoint supports this through the “speech-to-text” feature available on the platform.</p><h3 id="Set-up-captions-and-subtitles"><a href="#Set-up-captions-and-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Set up captions and subtitles"></a><strong>Set up captions and subtitles</strong></h3><p>Real-time display and translation are suitable for the multi-language purpose. You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1912746">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20231-1912746">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1912746.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmindmanager.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1912746%2F20231'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1912746/20231"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production.

The former runs on the mobile devices while the later runs with the computers and other gaming devices. There are so many different kinds of products for both these kinds to choose from.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Difference-Between-Mobile-and-Tethered-VR-Headsets"><a href="#Difference-Between-Mobile-and-Tethered-VR-Headsets" class="headerlink" title="Difference Between Mobile and Tethered VR Headsets"></a>Difference Between Mobile and Tethered VR Headsets</h2><p> If we talk about Tethered headsets, we see that they have combined displays, and they usually connect to personal computers or also to game systems using a cable. Whereas on the other hand, mobile headsets typically use smartphones for the display as well as processing; and in the absence of a smartphone, they’re nothing but just shells having lenses.</p><p> Tethered headsets designed to be large, they are expensive, and as well as they are also resource-intensive. They also claim more innovative motion-sensing and head-tracking abilities in opposite to mobile headsets. Other than that, not just the larger headsets consist of extensively devoted motion sensors, they also often work in combination with outside cameras to more exactly track the user’s head. Adding to that, they’re also designed to work with bodily controls, starting from keyboards and gamepads to more exclusive possibilities.</p><p> Now if we talk about the mobile headsets, they are small in size and cheap in price as compared to PC VR Headset. The reason is the most of the work is actually done by the smartphone, so the maximum price of mobile headset could be $100. Most of the mobile headsets are grounded on the Google Cardboard prototype, and with the exclusion of a magnetic switch, they do not have any motorized or electric components in the design; they are only screens with the lenses that divide user’s smartphone’s screen absolutely into two when he holds it to his face.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions"><a href="#When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="When to Choose Mobile Headset or a VR Headset? Purchasing Suggestions"></a>When to Choose Mobile Headset or a VR Headset? Purchasing Suggestions</h2><p> It is a very common question nowadays that what VR kind should be preferred to buy, tethered or mobile. Well, according to their use and qualities both of them are best in some senses and both of them has flaws in some other senses. It all depends on what needs do the user has. Now there are 2 options if you want a headset to try out this new technology and you want this gadget to be always with you wherever you go, you need to buy a mobile VR headset. But in the other case, if you want to completely enjoy this technology with powerful displays and want to have the best experience then there is no doubt you need to buy a tethered VR headset. It also depends on how much money do you have, because the tethered VR headset is very expensive because of its extra functionalities and ruthless display, whereas mobile VR headset are not so much good at display but they are cheap and an average person can easily afford them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Some-of-the-best-of-both-the-worlds"><a href="#Some-of-the-best-of-both-the-worlds" class="headerlink" title="Some of the best of both the worlds"></a>Some of the best of both the worlds</h3><p> LG’s new 360 VR, though, is present someplace in the mid of the best of the mobile headsets. It has its particular lenses and also the display but it is also tethered to the LG G5 mobile with the help of a USB cable. You can regulate things also with buttons present on the HMD or as well as by pushing and long-pressing the display of the smartphone. Audio voice can also come from the headphone jack present on the HMD or through the phone’s earphone port. It is still restricted by the smartphone’s dispensation power but by the presence of its personal lenses, it’s considerably well adapted to virtual reality as compared to Google Cardboard.</p><p> One of the other huge results of a tethered smartphone connection is of the 360 VR is very lighter in weight and debatably more contented than rather like the Gear VR, and it permits for adjustment of the optics. Though it may look awkward, it’s actually not considerably different than the 1st Sony Walkman, which also listed a trivial head gadget which is driven by a tethered device.</p><p><img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Essential-Techniques-for-Live-Video-Sharing-Platforms"><a href="#Essential-Techniques-for-Live-Video-Sharing-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="Essential Techniques for Live Video Sharing Platforms"></a>Essential Techniques for Live Video Sharing Platforms</h2><p>In today’s day and age, over 59% of all marketing agencies are live streaming their content for the most reach. That is pretty simple why they jump into the live streaming businesses. There are also lots of brands and content creators just getting started, basically learning how to live stream that run into complicated situations. How do you plan it? How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134230/18498" target="_top" id="2134230">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134230" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134230/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards.

However, this can only happen if the streamer you follow has turned on the “Save Replay” feature.</p><p>The replay will only last for 24 hours, and although the streamer won’t receive any notification, they will still be able to view the list of people, including you, who watched the replay.</p><p>Here’s how you can watch the Instagram live replay:</p><p><strong>Way 1: From the Story</strong></p><p>Step1 Launch the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=en&gl=US" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2 Search for the profile of your favorite <strong>Instagram live streamer.</strong></p><p>Step3 Check out their story and if they’ve shared their live video link, tap the <strong>“Play”</strong> button.

You can get YouTube subscriber by creating a video. This is also the hardest part of monetizing a channel. Unless the content is deeply satisfying, viewers watch dozens of videos without ever hitting subscriber. That’s why earning 4,000 watch hours could be easier than gaining YouTube subscriber.</p><p>YouTube channel become eligible for the YouTube partner program, which allows creator to monetize their videos with ads, plus reaching the other requirement of 4,000 hours of watch time and 1000 subscriber makes getting into YPP super easy. Monitizing your channel is a way to pay your video creation but before you will be monetized you need to reach YouTube requirements and one of this is to have a 1000 subscriber. But how you will get these thousand subscribers if you are a beginner.</p><p>To help you grow your YouTube subscriber here’s my tips that will help you retain attention on the video platform.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tips-on-How-to-Grow-YouTube-Subscriber"><a href="#Tips-on-How-to-Grow-YouTube-Subscriber" class="headerlink" title="Tips on How to Grow YouTube Subscriber"></a>Tips on How to Grow YouTube Subscriber</h2><h3 id="Quality-Content"><a href="#Quality-Content" class="headerlink" title="Quality Content"></a>Quality Content</h3><p>Identify which videos attract the most subscribers if you have 20 or more videos on your channel, why not see which ones attracted the most subscriber.</p><p>The only way to really stand out from the pack and grow your subscriber base it to create the best of the best content in your space. How to do it? Plan every video you want and always do research. Watch your competitors’ videos and jot down notes of the most intriguing parts. Rather than copying what your competition is doing, find a more a creative way to do it better. For example, I choose skin care review, before doing it I do research on how other creator do this kind of content for me to have an idea on how i deliver the information to my viewers. I make sure that i made my video different from others, straight to the point and always with the result of the product.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-quality-video-content.jpg"                      alt="create quality video content"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1976998">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1976998">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1976998.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1976998%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1976998/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube-Collab-To-Other-Content-Creator"><a href="#YouTube-Collab-To-Other-Content-Creator" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Collab To Other Content Creator"></a>YouTube Collab To Other Content Creator</h3><p>Because collaboration benefits everyone, working with influencer is a great way to get in front of potential subscriber to your channel. Try to reach out to similar users in your field and ask them out for an opportunity to work together on something interesting. Creator put a lot of work into video collaborations. They search for likeminded partners, brainstorm collab ideas, and film several videos together. But after all that work, the two creators get a priceless reward sharing their audiences. Doing research who to work with before deciding to collab some content creator will help you match with partners where you have a higher chance of gaining interested and engaged followers. Video collabs are a vital way to get YouTube subscribers, no matter the size of your channel</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/collab-with-other-content-creator.jpg"                      alt="collab with other content creator"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135360/19272" target="_top" id="2135360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135360/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube-Keywords-thumbnail-and-video-Titles"><a href="#YouTube-Keywords-thumbnail-and-video-Titles" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Keywords, thumbnail and video Titles"></a>YouTube Keywords, thumbnail and video Titles</h3><p>YouTube keywords are the foundations of any great channel, and they’re the best way to get traffic as a new creator. Adding relevant terms to your tittles and video description will help your content climb search result fast. Don’t make the tittle too long and make your title be descriptive as to give your audience a sneak peek as to what the video all about. Create a custom human thumbnail because your video thumbnails are essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. Using annotations and relevant images as custom thumbnail for your YouTube videos will increases your videos click through rate. Thumbnail help you attract new users to your channel and if you are not designing catchy thumbnail you are missing out a lot.</p><h3 id="Produce-a-High-Quality-Video"><a href="#Produce-a-High-Quality-Video" class="headerlink" title="Produce a High-Quality Video"></a>Produce a High-Quality Video</h3><p>Pay attention particularly to the lightning, audio and editing of your videos.

Never stop promoting your videos in all your social media platform. Some creators don’t have a problem getting subscribers.

If you wanted to be involved in very high-level camera work, then you would need some fancier gear, but for most people’s purposes, what they have on their phone is just fine. This article is aimed at looking at how people can use their iPhone to record good quality videos which they can enjoy with their friends.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Use-Stabilizers"><a href="#Use-Stabilizers" class="headerlink" title="Use Stabilizers"></a>Use Stabilizers</h2><p> Many people are critical of the ‘found footage’ types of movies which are sometimes released – the Blair Witch project being a prime example. This is generally because the shaky videography can make it difficult to really follow what is going on, or possibly also because it is hard to watch without feeling ill.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/stabilizer.jpg"                      alt="stabilizer"                ></p><p> This same complaint is often used in iPhone videography – it is difficult to follow because the video is shaking. The shaking is what happens when the video lacks stability – remember that most professional camera work is done with cameras which are on some form of frame or tripod to keep the camera still. It isn’t that an iPhone is heavy – it is more to do with the video being hard to keep still, especially if our attention is distracted. For the best videos, people should invest in some form of tripod for their phone.</p><h2 id="Use-Light-Properly"><a href="#Use-Light-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Use Light Properly"></a>Use Light Properly</h2><p> Professional video shoots use a lot of light in order to create the proper effect – most people would be surprised to learn how much light goes into even a ‘night-time’ set. Phone videos often suffer a lot because they do not make adequate use of light. Part of this can be solved by taking a camera class which covers light issues, but it can also be solved by paying attention to light sources where you are, and changing them to better suit your video if possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/set-light-iphone.jpg"                      alt="light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087390/7443" target="_top" id="2087390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Avoid-Using-the-Digital-Zoom"><a href="#Avoid-Using-the-Digital-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Using the Digital Zoom"></a>Avoid Using the Digital Zoom</h2><p> It can be very tempting to try and use the zoom function on your camera to see people better, but this ultimately doesn’t work. You will end up with a grainy video of uncertain quality, rather than one which allows you to see everything in close up. Just move towards the point you are attempting to film – the quality of the video will be better, and you will not have to fiddle with controls and menus while making the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/Zoom.jpg"                      alt="zoom"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-the-Grid"><a href="#Use-the-Grid" class="headerlink" title="Use the Grid"></a>Use the Grid</h2><p> Pictures and videos can be taken in either portrait or landscape format, as everybody who has tried to take a picture knows. When recording a video, you should use this to your advantage and try and find which grid would be the most effective for your video. Using the grids is very easy - simply tip the iPhone in the direction you want to film, and the film will automatically work in that format. Since it can be very easy for a phone to change grids while videoing, this is another opportunity for a stabiliser such as a tripod to be put into use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/grid-iphone-camera.png"                      alt="grid"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-the-Exposure-Lock"><a href="#Use-the-Exposure-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Use the Exposure Lock"></a>Use the Exposure Lock</h2><p> When taking a video or a picture, you will have noticed that it can change the colour and the exposure while trying to get a lock and fix on what it is going to be recording. While it is good that it tries to find the best way to accommodate the light and sound in the room, having your video change exposure throughout will be at best annoying and at worst an outright distraction. Lock your exposure down on the iPhone once you have found the optimum conditions for the video, and it will not change.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/lock-exposure.jpg"                      alt="exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Use-Slow-Motion-Time-Lapse-Mode"><a href="#Use-Slow-Motion-Time-Lapse-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Use Slow Motion\Time Lapse Mode"></a>Use Slow Motion\Time Lapse Mode</h2><p> One way to make videos more interesting is to use either slow motion or time lapse features. The well-known use of time lapse video is if the video is extremely long, and it needs to be shortened – we are all aware of the use of montages in films, after all – and it can be very effective when used correctly. Slow motion is different - it can be used for the same reasons as in films, but it can also be used for when you need to follow instructions, or for when you want to follow what is being done in absolute detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/time-lapse-iphone.jpg"                      alt="time lapse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Put-your-iPhone-in-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Put-your-iPhone-in-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your iPhone in Airplane Mode"></a>Put your iPhone in Airplane Mode</h2><p> There is nothing worse than being in the middle of recording a great video, and then being interrupted by a notification. Even worse, since phones vibrate when they receive a notification, and it will ruin the entire video if that happens, since the phone will move and throw off the exposure and the light enhancements which you have been using.</p><p> Putting your phone in airplane mode allows you to stop any notifications from coming in at all, and thus keeping them from ruining your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode"                ></p><h2 id="Edit-your-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-your-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit your Video with Filmora"></a>Edit your Video with Filmora</h2><p> Films go through extensive editing processes before being released to the general public, so why shouldn’t you edit your videos? Things go wrong in the process of making a video – somebody appears where they shouldn’t, a phone rings, people have conversations, the tripod falls down, the camera ends up pointed the wrong way….a lot can happen. Editing your video means that you can take all these problems out, and also means that you can tighten up the video generally, improve the sound quality, and make sure that everything is as it should be before you show it off.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857865/11832" target="_top" id="857865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857865/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Using your iPhone to make a video is not something which requires a lot of extra equipment – it simply requires some planning on your part, as well as knowledge of your iPhone’s systems. Being able to control the grid for the videos, the exposure, and anything else which can be controlled through the iPhone systems makes for much better videos off the bat, while adding in video editing software and tripods can improve the experience even more. Videos on an iPhone shouldn’t be seen as impossible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-filming-your-journey-essentials-checklist/"><u>[New] Filming Your Journey – Essentials Checklist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unbeatable-11-audio-devices-reviewed-here/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unbeatable 11 Audio Devices Reviewed Here</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-reimagine-the-way-you-take-notes-with-mematic/"><u>[New] Reimagine the Way You Take Notes with Mematic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-aplus-tiktok-videos-with-designed-templates/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to A+ TikTok Videos with Designed Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-ice-skates-and-epochs-a-look-at-beijings-olympic-saga-2022/"><u>[Updated] Ice Skates & Epochs A Look at Beijing's Olympic Saga, 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevating-aerial-photography-with-gopro-karma/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevating Aerial Photography with GoPro Karma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-iphone-photo-mastering-free-picture-smoothing-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, IPhone Photo Mastering FREE Picture Smoothing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/1-best-live-streaming-apps-discover-manycam-and-virtual-webcams/"><u>1.

We’ve enlisted the easier steps for Funimate creating accounts. This mobile platform easily dominated the large market for mobile applications. The Funimate video app combines all of the popular features of Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube into a single app. This application is quite popular among students. Even adults like viewing videos and generating their material in their spare time. This application became very famous among US teenagers, and then everyone began talking about it all around the globe.</p><p>Apps such as Funimate allow for video editing on mobile devices. This was a pain a while ago. It was difficult to find a video editor for mobile devices, and you could only edit movies on a computer. Video editing on mobile devices running iOS or Android has become feasible, with applications including a plethora of video editing options. As a result, editing on the fly becomes a breeze. Funimate also has an effects mix tool that includes 100 complex video effects. You may also utilize the effects for the intro and outro.

When you first use the app, you will be provided with two options: “Create an Account” and “Login.” Users must have an email, Facebook, or Twitter account, as well as a Google Play or iTunes account, to register.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-funimate-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="download funimate"                ></p><p>Step 2: To enjoy the free trial, you must click “Subscribe,” and they will be alerted immediately that a payment has been made. Although the app’s terms of service specify that users must be 13 to register for an account, there is no age verification.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-account-funimate.jpg"                      alt="create account funimate"                ></p><p>Step 3: Before you continue, be sure to read the “Terms of Use” and “Privacy Policy” on the official website, since this might have serious consequences.</p><p>Step 4: Clicking “Create an Account” will take you to the next screen. If you have already registered, it will display “Email Address already registered.” In this scenario, you must utilize the lost password option to regain access to your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sign-up-funimate.jpg"                      alt="sign up funimate"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-for-Logging-in-to-Funimate"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-for-Logging-in-to-Funimate" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps for Logging in to Funimate"></a>Part 2: Steps for Logging in to Funimate</h2><p>Users begin by establishing a profile, which may be done by linking a social network account or by entering their phone number. They may look for and follow other people after creating a profile. Users may share their creations on Funimate as well as other social networking platforms.</p><p>Step 1: Once completed, open the app on your mobile device or tablet. To use the Funimate App, create an account or log in using your Facebook or Gmail account.</p><p>Step 2: You may enter your Username or Email address that you used to establish your account, as well as the password connected with it. If you utilised a social network, just click on the appropriate button.</p><p>Step 3: Once you’ve signed in, you’ll be sent to the home page, where you’ll notice a variety of choices such as following, featured, lit, tutorials, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funimate-homepage.jpg"                      alt="funimate homepage"                ></p><h5 id="Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Video Editor"></a>Filmora Video Editor</h5><p>Cut, trim, join videos with ease</p><p>Add transitions and green screen effects</p><p>Split screen, AI portrait and more</p><p>Share vidoes to social platforms</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Get-Full-Subscription-and-Effects-on-Funimate"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Get-Full-Subscription-and-Effects-on-Funimate" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Get Full Subscription and Effects on Funimate"></a>Part 3: How to Get Full Subscription and Effects on Funimate</h2><p>The application populates user profiles with followers who must be actively unfollowed, but it also provides users with many privacy settings, such as the ability to make their accounts private, restrict comments and collaborations, and block other users from sharing their videos.

Let’s get right into it:</p><p><strong>Steps to Get Featured Pack of Funimate</strong></p><p>Step 1: Visit the Google Play and App Stores. Now look for the Funimate App. After that, download and install the most recent version of the Funimate App on your Android and iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funimate-app-android.jpg"                      alt="funimate app android"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, navigate to your profile and then touch on the Settings symbol in the upper right corner.

Users may use this application to edit their movies by trimming, cutting, cropping, merging, duplicating, collaging, and looping clips. Users may also use features to blur, vary the pace, fade in and out, animate text, add GIFs, and include music to their films. However, if you’ve been using Funimate for a time, it’s not uncommon to decide to modify one or both. Perhaps you used your actual name and were unaware that it would be made public. Perhaps the name you initially picked is no longer appropriate for the sort of material you want to publish. Or maybe you’ve just decided that you’d rather be known by something more intriguing.</p><p><strong>Step to Edit Free Funimate Pro Account</strong></p><p>Step 1: Launch the Funimate app and choose the Profile option in the lower right corner of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-funimate-app.jpg"                      alt="launch funimate"                ></p><p>Step 2: Choose Shoot a Video or Edit to update your feed and for the profile name, go to the sign up step to enter your new name here. In the case of your username, keep in mind that it must be unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shoot-a-video-funimate.jpg"                      alt="shoot a video funimate"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Navigate to your profile page on the Funimate app. Tap on the ‘Profile’ icon in the bottom right-hand corner to view your profile. After all, your social media profile photo is part of how you promote yourself to the world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/profile-in-funimate.jpg"                      alt="profile in funimate"                ></p><p>Step 4: Choose one of the choices shown in the popup window. You may upload a picture, snap a new one, or just examine your existing photo and crop it again to improve it.</p><p>Step 5: Whether you want more followers or want people to understand your content area better, you should describe it in your bio. This is a short tagline that informs other users about what they can anticipate from your Funimate account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tagline-in-funimate.jpg"                      alt="tagline in funimate"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With the proper privacy settings, Funimate is suitable for adult adolescent users. By default, Funimate profiles are set to public, however, they may be changed to private. Having a private account is significantly safer for children, particularly if they wish to make videos of themselves. Users may opt to make individual videos private if they wish to have a public profile. A full profile page is an excellent method to persuade people to follow you on Funimate. However, to remain current, you need to update it regularly. Just be cautious not to make too many changes, since this may make it difficult for your followers to keep up.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Get-Full-Subscription-and-Effects-on-Funimate-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Get-Full-Subscription-and-Effects-on-Funimate-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Get Full Subscription and Effects on Funimate"></a>Part 3: How to Get Full Subscription and Effects on Funimate</h2><p>The application populates user profiles with followers who must be actively unfollowed, but it also provides users with many privacy settings, such as the ability to make their accounts private, restrict comments and collaborations, and block other users from sharing their videos.

Just be cautious not to make too many changes, since this may make it difficult for your followers to keep up.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-framefulness-selecting-the-top-websites-and-apps-for-photoshopping/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Framefulness Selecting the Top Websites & Apps for Photoshopping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-make-a-good-podcast-trailer/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved How To Make A Good Podcast Trailer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-how-to-on-using-voice-input-in-google-docs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Ultimate How-To on Using Voice Input in Google Docs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-your-creative-potential-without-spending/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unlocking Your Creative Potential Without Spending</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-gopro-showdown-full-review-and-ratings/"><u>[Updated] GoPro Showdown Full Review and Ratings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-evaluating-costs-for-youtube-ad-campaigns/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Evaluating Costs for YouTube Ad Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-cartoon-selfies-snapchats-fun-lens-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Cartoon Selfies Snapchat's Fun Lens Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-pinnacle-pdf-transformations/"><u>[Updated] Pinnacle PDF Transformations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-precision-narrative-craftsmanship-how-to-write-impressive-docu-scripts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Precision Narrative Craftsmanship How to Write Impressive Docu-Scripts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-starter-guide-8-easy-youtube-money-makers/"><u>[Updated] Starter Guide 8 Easy YouTube Money-Makers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-full-picture-unraveling-the-google-podcast-application/"><u>2024 Approved Full Picture Unraveling the Google Podcast Application</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-smart-guide-for-spawning-share-worthy-memes-in-9gag/"><u>2024 Approved The Smart Guide for Spawning Share-Worthy Memes in 9GAG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/disable-unsolicited-youtube-video-listings-for-2024/"><u>Disable Unsolicited YouTube Video Listings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-from-oppo-find-x7-ultra-phones-withwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock from Oppo Find X7 Ultra Phones with/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/in-2024-launch-your-clips-free-intro-downloads/"><u>In 2024, Launch Your Clips Free Intro Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-lenovo-laptop-screen-logging-made-easy/"><u>In 2024, Lenovo Laptop Screen Logging Made Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/is-revenue-derived-from-evaluating-products-for-2024/"><u>Is Revenue Derived From Evaluating Products for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/mp3ize-your-soundcloud-music-effortlessly-top-tips-and-tricks-revealed/"><u>MP3ize Your SoundCloud Music Effortlessly - Top Tips and Tricks Revealed!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-take-a-screenshot-share-the-fun-a-guide-to-ps4-online-sharing-for-2024/"><u>New Take a Screenshot, Share the Fun A Guide to PS4 Online Sharing for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075476/7443" target="_top" id="2075476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Professionals rate it as a top end machine that is best fitted for low budget applications. The most interesting part to talk about is its Wi-Fi, LNA streaming, smart content and 3D view. You can easily buy this high quality CD spinner with a price tag below £100 and it can fulfil all your desires with ease. It provides everything at single place with advanced Blu-deck creation but you will miss that 4K upscaling ability. Further, this blu-ray player is highly compatible with LG’s Music Flow multiroom platform so that users can enjoy easy music streaming facility from USB as well as CDs directly to the LG systems.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It offers pin sharp details for pictures.</li><li>Impressive on screen design along with slick app.</li><li>Users love its multiroom support.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Competitors are offering wide range of features as compared to BP550 and even on the lower price range.</li><li>It does not support optical audio output.</li><li>You will observe DVD upscaling artefacts.</li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p>BP550 device allows its users to enjoy with a wide range of premium content where all highlights are managed with Sky’s Now TV and Spotify. You will not be able to find these players on competing devices. Note that, you need to subscribe to stay connected on these channels. However, your subscription will also lead to convenient access for video and music content via living room system.</p><p>Here is one more thing to know about advanced features of this device. The Spotify and the Now TV as now joined by Berliner Philharmoniker, Dailymotion, CineTrailer, iConcerts, Deezer, YouTube, BBC sport, BBC News, blink box, Amazon Instant Video, Netfix and BBC Player. The Smart world section is missing in this device but it is carrying lifestyle apps, puzzles and wealth of games.</p><p>You can use BP550 to access photos, music, videos etc directly from server of the same connected network. The offered file support greatly depends upon server software that you are using but if we talk just about LG’s BP550 abilities then it can process OGG, FLAC, WAV, WMA, plus MP3 along with few classy ones like Mov, 3GP, WMV, AVI, XviD and MKV etc. BP550 is also capable enough to transmit music directly from USM sticks or CDs to music flow audio mechanism where connections are made through Wi-Fi. Those who love to spend time to listen CDs in room even without a disc player will find this connectivity option more useful. On the other side, Private</p><p>Sound Mode is one more interesting feature of BP550 as it assists users to share their favourite audio content with smartphones via Wi-Fi so that it can be enjoyed using headphones without disturbing surroundings.</p><p>For a while, let us move out of the fancy stuff and talk about basic features then also you will find a great list of features like DVD upscaling up to 1080p, 3D Playback, DTS HD based Master Audio decoding, Dolly TrueHD.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-3.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068417/7443" target="_top" id="2068417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068417/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-and-Connections"><a href="#Design-and-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Design and Connections"></a>Design and Connections</h2><p>Addition of advanced 3D support into a device increases its overall weight by 2 grams but still if you compare it with other devices then this weight will be considered as lighter. Users love the textured black plastic casing of this device that is equipped with front left tray loading system. This device is designed with minimalistic controls so the last important things that you are going to find on its body are power and eject buttons only. USB port is available on one side that provides easy connectivity for external storage devices. You will not be able to find any display panel on this device but the green LED provides indication whenever device is switched on.</p><p>If we compare this design with BP350 then the remote control feature can be found with improved appearance. It offers well designed tiny buttons with impressive layout that assists beginners with easy controls. Other than this, you can access all controls via LG 4G Remote App that is compatible with iOS and Android platform. A nice addition of HDMI output as compared to its predecessor is available so that users can directly avail digital audio out and the LAN port assists in easy HD streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-1.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975816/19272" target="_top" id="1975816">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975816" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975816/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Operation"><a href="#Operation" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><p>Once you start using LG’s BP550 device you will love its abilities and convenience that it offers to every user with ease. Deck always responds smoothly whenever users switch between different folders on music servers or whenever they try to punch passwords. However, the menu system is almost same as that of its predecessor. The home menu is impressively easy to navigate with a row of five well managed tiles that appear good against a gray background. All the app highlights as well as corresponding app statuses are displayed in a purple section below. If you want to adjust settings then follow the menu and it makes everything simple even with better control on all critical adjustments.</p><p>When it is time to delve into DLNA server then users can navigate inside for easy access of content from so many folders. Once you start playing a track, it will immediately appear on the whole screen and a beautiful cover art will appear along with elapsed time and playlist information. The online content menu is showcased via grid of tiles that reflect a cartoony backdrop but looks beautiful. You can jump between different apps as it provides better control on cursor that is highly smooth. When you need direct access to Option and Disc Menus then simply hit the info button at the time of playback and the banner appears on bottom side of screen. All useful apps like Spotify and BBC iPlayer works smoothly on this platform while allowing easy access to streaming. The info button will provide you perfect details about disc related to subtitles, audio formats etc. further, you can have easy controls over Movie, Vivid and standard settings. Users can make fine adjustments over sharpness, colour, brightness and contrast.</p><p>You will get one remote unit with this system that makes controlling much easier with an intuitive button type layout. The useful playback keys are well placed over ‘hump’ and they have light controlled appearance with dark and bright settings. The large direction panel assists users with ease navigation controls. Alternatively, users can connect their smartphones with this device via Wi-Fi connectivity and it is compatible with iOS and Android platform. This remote access can be used to access various apps, playback controls, DLNA servers and for track streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-2.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>Now, with this improved LG product we have something to talk about 3D performance that was earlier missing in its predecessors. No matter what kind of procedures and technologies were used to transmit digital information, you will always find results for 3D images impressive. If you must leave picture options alone then BP550 can assist you with perfect colour blending along with well adjusted gamma curve. It is also possible to make few picture altering adjustments that are available in Options Menu below Info&#x2F;Menu button of remote.</p><p>If you work with standard picture mode then it will offer perfect transmission of signals between different platforms. Both Video ad Cinema modes produce colour information but it should not be messed up with illumination. User mode is highly important as it displays things as per standard with impressive basic controls over brightness, color, contrast etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-550-4.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p>Although, BP550 lacks somewhere in high end feature delivery but still its intuitive controls make it stand out against all competitors.

This IPS panel shows very impressive performance for grayscale test where every shade ranging between light and dark was presented smoothly so that viewers can enjoy impressive display. You will definitely love its viewing angle performance as it does not cause any decay in information on extreme bottom, side or top ranges. Other than this, HP Envy works with AMD’s FreeSync technology that improves performance over tearing issue. Motion blur is perfectly adjusted with its slow 14 ms pixel response whereas input lag for display is 41.1 ms.</p><h4 id="3-FreeSync-Compatibility"><a href="#3-FreeSync-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="3. FreeSync Compatibility"></a>3. FreeSync Compatibility</h4><p> With lots of incredible technology additions, this monitor also has AMD’s FreeSync ability. This feature is really useful for gamers who need consistent performance at 60Hz. However, this feature finds limited application here because most of the latest mobile units cannot handle 4K games with ease. As mobile units are designed to be energy efficient, thin and portable so they are not able to carry AMD’s Radeon Graphic Processor. However, IGPs designed with Intel processor can handle this feature well but they do not allow games with FreeSync accepted frame rates.</p><h4 id="4-Responsiveness"><a href="#4-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="4. Responsiveness"></a>4. Responsiveness</h4><p> As we already know that HP Envy is designed with FreeSync technology but at the same time it offers 14ms response time, this rating shows little disturbance for motion blur adjustment. Also, the input lag was observed to be 41.1 ms. This monitor consumes about 37 watts power at natural color temperature mode but it does not possess ECO power saving ability.</p><p> Responsiveness matters a lot for gamers because they cannot take a chance to allow frames lag behind even by single second. Especially in the person shooting games and latest action games, you cannot compromise for delay in display of details on screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424528">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424528">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424528%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424528/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> In case if you are searching for a large screen elegant UHD monitor then HP Envy is one of the best choices.

It brings perfection with time management</h3><p>LUTs aid in pleasing the client, completing the job on time, and achieving magnificent cinematic hues. A LUT is easy to use and only requires a few clicks. Whether lifestyle, personal, or business, some projects might take a long time to edit. Some projects have a very tight schedule, and editing can even be done overnight! LUTs come in handy in this situation. Most experts have had clients who demand video as soon as possible but have no idea how long it takes to create a video! It takes a lot longer than they anticipate.</p><p>However, you still want to provide a good project; color grading might take a long time to go through all of the clips and make them appear beautiful, and you may not have the time. Here, LUTs can definitely help.</p><h3 id="2-It-provides-a-polished-finish"><a href="#2-It-provides-a-polished-finish" class="headerlink" title="2. It provides a polished finish"></a>2. It provides a polished finish</h3><p>Lookup tables might save you time when editing, but for many creative filmmakers and editors, LUTs are a way of polishing the final appearance of a film. When color grading is poorly done, it can impair the aesthetic of a movie and distract the audience. The beautiful thing about LUTs is that most of them on the market are created by other videographers, so you know they’ll work on your movies right out of the box; all you have to do is make little tweaks to match the vision you have in your brain. If you’ve never used LUTs before but want to take your short films to an extraordinary level, try cinematic LUTs, which will give you that blockbuster vibe on a budget.</p><h3 id="3-A-command-to-adaptability"><a href="#3-A-command-to-adaptability" class="headerlink" title="3. A command to adaptability"></a>3. A command to adaptability</h3><p>They’re highly adaptable. LUTs can be utilized to convert Log film back to the Rec709 standard, making the Log color profile more approachable to users who don’t have years of color grading expertise. Professionals generally employ log color space to increase dynamic range and sustain shadows and highlights in contrasting scenes. Conversion LUTs now assist in getting over the arduous task of color grading Log footage.</p><p>Many pros and amateurs use conversion LUTs to make this step considerably easier. Many LUTs, notably creative LUTs, are compatible with a video that has been converted to Rec709 from Log. For use on Rec709 standard color film, creative LUTs typically preserve the cinematic and stylish colors. Rec709 is the most common color profile used by most cameras, making it the easiest to work with.</p><h3 id="4-It-gives-a-hint-of-professionalism"><a href="#4-It-gives-a-hint-of-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="4. It gives a hint of professionalism"></a>4. It gives a hint of professionalism</h3><p>Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Davinci Resolve, and other programs can use LUTs. They’re ideal for any video where you want to create a distinct appearance or vibe. LUTs are essential for any aspiring or established filmmaker. They’re utilized to quickly create high-quality visuals that give any project a polished look. They can also be used to give your video an overall color tone.</p><h3 id="5-Creativity-at-your-fingertips"><a href="#5-Creativity-at-your-fingertips" class="headerlink" title="5. Creativity at your fingertips"></a>5. Creativity at your fingertips</h3><p>LUTs are a quick and easy way to achieve colors. Consider LUTs to be color grading professionals who share their knowledge via a LUT file. They do all of the heavy lifting, so you don’t have to. Of course, some modifications may be necessary to make it suit perfectly with your camera video, but this is far easier than conducting the color grading process yourself, mainly if you aren’t interested in learning how to color grade yet or just don’t have the time.</p><p>Specifically, you need to acquire intricate color grading tools that are difficult to grasp if you haven’t used them before. Pros even use LUTs in feature films. So don’t think they’re just for folks who don’t want to color grade; they’re utilized across the board in filmmaking.</p><p>Professionals utilize them to get a rough concept of how the film will look after the final grade is completed by looking at the monitors they use. LUTs are simply temporary file that instructs the computer to go from one set of colors to another. As a result, the professionals’ expertise can be readily kept in this file and distributed to everyone who uses them.</p><p>Empower your videos with a new mood using different LUTs.</p><p>For more easy-to-use effects and filters to make your video cinematic, have a try with Filmora!

As I understand things, this is because Dolby HDR is not supported.</em></p><p><em>Is there a workaround I can use to get the color back in my videos?</em></p><p><em>Also, any ideas when Adobe will eventually provide support for Dolby HDR?” – A user asked from Adobe Support Community</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="solutions for iphone hdr"                ></p><p>While the Adobe Premiere Pro software is useful tool for video editing, there are situations when the video quality looks overexposed. The quality appears blown out during the import process. This happens due to incompatibility issues with the Smart HDR feature in iPhone 12 series devices, which cannot work on older models.</p><p>There are particular ways in which it is possible to rectify the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video</strong> quality issue. In this article, we discuss that further.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983551">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983551">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983551.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983551%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983551/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

You can add pre-set effects in the software package or adjust color grading in the videos. The two main color-related adjustments you can make are Color Correction and Color Match to sync the video visuals with zero washed-out look or distortions.</p><p>The only drawback here for editing Dolby Vision HDR footage is that it does not work directly on iPhones. You can make the edits on a Mac computer and then directly export them to iPhones.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a or  () format.</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly.

Choose your option carefully.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Overall, it is possible for the HDR quality videos captured with an iPhone 12 camera to look overexposed&#x2F;washed out. This is because the Dolby Vision effect is not compatible with many devices and platforms and is not an issue with editing software like Premiere Pro. You can fix the problem by disabling the HDR effect, using a high-quality video editor like Filmora, or changing the color codec.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Solution-2-Get-a-Video-Editing-Software-that-you-can-Edit-Dolby-Vision-Footage-in-Recommended-1"><a href="#Solution-2-Get-a-Video-Editing-Software-that-you-can-Edit-Dolby-Vision-Footage-in-Recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Get a Video-Editing Software that you can Edit Dolby Vision Footage in [Recommended]"></a>Solution 2: Get a Video-Editing Software that you can Edit Dolby Vision Footage in [Recommended]</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best video editing software choices available currently, with a range of high-quality editing functions. You can add pre-set effects in the software package or adjust color grading in the videos. The two main color-related adjustments you can make are Color Correction and Color Match to sync the video visuals with zero washed-out look or distortions.</p><p>The only drawback here for editing Dolby Vision HDR footage is that it does not work directly on iPhones. You can make the edits on a Mac computer and then directly export them to iPhones. So, overall, using this software is the best option to try to <strong>convert HDR video to SDR iPhone,</strong> in our experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to edit iPhone HDR video using Filmora?</strong></p><p>Step1Install Filmora and launch the software on your Mac device.</p><p>Step2Click on New Project &gt; Click here to import media.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-4.jpg"                      alt="click on new project"                ></p><p>Choose the HDR video from the iPhone device that you transferred to the device in QuickTime Movie format (MOV).</p><p>Step3Drag and drop the video to the timeline section for editing the file.</p><p>Step4Make the necessary edits like Color Matching and Chroma key-based background removal&#x2F;editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/solutions-for-iphone-hdr-video-washed-out-in-premiere-pro-5.jpg"                      alt="make edits"                ></p><p>Step5Click on the Export button on top of the screen.</p><p>Step6Go to the Device tab and choose iPhone.

This is a solution that the official Adobe Premiere team provides as a failsafe solution. Here, the process works for files in JPEG 2000 MXF OP1a or  () format.</p><p>During the export, you can change the file format to one of the two, depending on your file type. While following the JPEG 2000 route, make changes to the Depth&#x2F;Chroma as RGB 4:4:4 12-bit PQ. Then, it is possible to turn to Rec 2020 from the Color Primitives setting.</p><p>On the other hand, you have to change the Main profile choice to Main 10 under the Video tab if you are changing to  () format. Then, activate the Color Primaries for Rec.2020.</p><p>While this is an officially vetted process, we will not recommend it as a suitable solution here. The sequence may not work on some devices&#x2F;systems and make the quality worse than before.</p><h3 id="Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1"><a href="#Solution-4-Change-codec-to-change-color-translation-into-Premiere-Untested-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]"></a>Solution 4: Change codec to change color translation into Premiere [Untested]</h3><p>It is possible to directly load the file in QuickTime mode on the Mac device one is using. The process can take anything between 1 to 10 minutes for the whole exporting process to work, depending on the film’s length and network speed.</p><p>The newly imported file should have the same high-quality color resolutions that befit an HDR video. You might have to do some color tweaking first with third-party software, like <strong>Blackmagic video assist 7.</strong></p><p>Not to mention, the quality of the video might not resemble the original perfectly. This method is not widely tested and authorized, so use it as a last resort or with a professional editor’s help.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-iPhone-HDR-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video"></a>Part 4: Hot FAQs on iPhone HDR Video</h2><h3 id="1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1"><a href="#1-Does-YouTube-support-Apple’s-iPhone-12-Dolby-Vision-HDR-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1.
