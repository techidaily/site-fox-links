This side project became an instant success for Google and has attracted customers all around the world costing only 20$ this is one of the cheapest headsets anyone can get in the market. The best thing about Google cardboard is that the design is open source and anyone can make one at home just by following few clear instructions. Google’s vision of technology to everyone is working and cardboard is one step towards their main goal.</p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is the product that comes when you combine the expertise of the best Virtual Reality Company and the best smart phone brand in the world. Samsung Gear VR is a combined collaboration between Samsung and Oculus. This Virtual reality headset is made for only Samsung phones and retails around 100$ which is almost 5 times more than the Google cardboard. Gear VR is packed with functionality it has a very firm phone stand inside of which you can easily put any phone. It connects to your phone through the charging port and as soon as you connect the phone it starts the VR software in it. You can also control the volume and the zoom through this headset. You can also play many games on it through the Oculus app which is present on the app store for Gear VR only.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a>Samsung Gear VR</h3><p> Samsung just partnered with Oculus to bring you the Samsung Gear VR headset in 2014 and now the new Samsung Gear VR introduced with the Galaxy S7 is jam packed with new features that are ready to blow your mind. The new Gear is 19 percent lighter than the previous model so it doesn’t feel like a brick tied to your head. The straps are more elastic and give a better fit than the previous model, the padding around the eyes and nose gives a very comfortable grip. The new VR has a USB type c port you can also switch it micro USB to make it compatible with the older versions of Samsung phones.</p><p> The best part about the new Samsung Gear is the new lens that is clearer and gives a glare free view of the screen. Along with the new lens there are some more features in the Samsung Gear VR, You can plug in headphones in your phone and enjoy the whole VR experience with sound Samsung ahs specially made ports in the headset for it. Samsung has also introduced some buttons to change the volume of the device from the Gear itself. The previous versions had a problem that the lenses tend to mist up thus making you unable to see clearly but in this version the issue has been resolved.</p><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a>Google Cardboard</h3><p> Google has been changing our concepts about technology for quite some time now and they are certainly succeeding in their mission. Google Cardboard is a product started by Google employees as a side project but it certainly became more than a side project. The main selling point of the Cardboard is that it is really cheap and everyone can afford one. Plus you don’t need a high end smart phone to work with cardboard it can work with any android phone. The Google cardboard VR is compatible with multiple phones and is really portable and these are its basic selling points. Other than that there are not many qualities in the headset it is just a cardboard holder that you have to hold with hand with lens in it.</p><p> Google cardboard does not have any volume control options no flaps straps to attach the device directly on your head, the build quality is as poor as it can get. There are many downsides to the Google cardboard but if you look at its price you realize it is a pretty good deal for 20$ you are getting a VR headset who would’ve thought this was possible?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-convenient-mobile-watch-enabledisable-picture-in-picture-in-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Convenient Mobile Watch  Enable/Disable Picture-In-Picture in YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-5-seascape-accessories-for-gopro-lenses/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Top 5 Seascape Accessories for GoPro Lenses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-multimedia-slides-with-speech-recordings-powerpoint/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Multimedia Slides with Speech Recordings (PowerPoint)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/compreenas-an-insightful-guide-to-photography-mastery/"><u>Compreenas  An Insightful Guide to Photography Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/effortless-mpeg-creation-from-youtube-content/"><u>Effortless MPEG Creation From YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-best-frame-rate-selection-for-effective-slow-motion-capture/"><u>[Updated] Best Frame Rate Selection for Effective Slow Motion Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-b-roll-wisdom-enhancing-your-cinematic-quality/"><u>2024 Approved  B-Roll Wisdom  Enhancing Your Cinematic Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-your-iphone-12-pro-max-in-security-lockout-proper-ways-to-unlock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Is Your iPhone 12 Pro Max in Security Lockout?

Earlier, they were focused only on development of E Sports displays and gaming accessories but now company has brought eye catching models of professional monitors into market. They have designed high quality products even with affordable price tag as compared to Asus and Dell. BenQ BL2711U is one of the most popular monitor for professional users, offering outstanding 4K graphics, 60Hz performance on its 27” screen. There are so many unique and impressive things to discuss about BenQ BL2711U; go through the detailed review below to gain complete information about it.</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features"><a href="#Design-and-Features" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features"></a>Design and Features</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> Considering the design of BenQ BL2711U we must say that this monitor is designed to serve users in mild environments like design studios or offices. Manufacturers have not added much bling to this design rather they focused more on minimalistic design that can suit to professional atmosphere. The cabinet was finished with attractive matte black exterior where the grippy, subtle and finger print free texture make it more appealing. The bezels have same appearance as that of the cabinet so you will not observe any distraction for viewing experience on this 27” screen. BenQ BL2711U is finished with a medium range anti glare coating so you can have a reflection free view but it introduces little grainy texture to this monitor. Note that the stand attached to this BL series appears almost same as that of old XL series. Users can rotate, swivel, tilt and rise this display as per their own needs.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-bl2711u-ports.jpg"                      alt="benq-bl2711u-ports"                ></p><p> All the connections are placed on rear portion of the cabinet and they are facing downward. Such kind of orientation assist in better cable management as one can easily take them out from the neck hole on the mount. The connectivity options for input include HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2 that works on 60Hz rating for delivering 4K content. In case of HDMI 1.4 port and the DVI port, you will be able to operate monitor for 30Hz range whereas separate USB ports are added for downstream and upstream needs. This panel also consists of a dedicated switch for On&#x2F;Off operations that makes this monitor handy.

Color"></a>1. Color</h4><p> BenQ BL2711U is designed to serve users with incredible 4K experience on its IPS panel. It presents all the details with stunning clarity that you will not find in any of the competitive range products. The most special features of this 27” monitor are its 10 bit color interface that can handle 1.07 billion colours with higher accuracy. The combination of advanced technologies leads to 100% color range coverage with Rec 709 and sRGB. You will find its color details extremely vibrant as well as accurate; the native resolutions are meant to be clear and crisp. The drawback of this design is hidden within Adobe RGB performance ability that leads to less useful gamut coverage and second issue is inability to handle extended spectrum of colours, so all these features make this monitor suitable for video and photo professionals. Most of the high end professionals need 12 bit interface but the design cost for that one simply goes high. If we look at price tag of BenQ BL2711U then it appears best for entry level users and general professional needs. The wide range of features covered with this monitor make it suitable for several work related applications, especially for those who are not much specific about higher color accuracy.</p><h4 id="2-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#2-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2.OSD and Settings"></a>2.OSD and Settings</h4><p> One major feature of BenQ BL2711U is the range of OSD modes added to this product.

Lines as well as Wireframes show satisfactory performance and the contrast setting never causes any strain on eyes because it can adjust all pictures to natural appearance. The colours appear vibrant on this screen and you will not find any disturbance in shades. Some users may notice little issue related to blue hue over pictures but thanks to advanced blue light filter that can easily handle this trouble.</p><p> Users can easily adjust the performance of Blue Light Filter for BenQ BL2711U as per the named profiles available on menu.

These features assist users to have strain free viewing experience with higher comfort. You will be glad to know that along with the classic filters, BenQ BL2711U is flicker free too.

After all these software based safety adjustments, BenQ BL2711U also contains Automatic Eye Protect Sensor in its hardware that can manage brightness as per the ambient light.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> With lots of incredible features, BenQ BL2711U can be considered for professional needs.

Being a photo text editor, you need to be careful about every element that is across the photo. Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:</p><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-Perspective-3"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Perspective-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Perspective"></a>1. Understanding the Perspective</h3><p>Adding text as a perspective is believed to be an inclusive way of providing viewers with the idea of the image and helping them understand it to the fullest. If you are looking forward to writing a text on photos,you can give your text a little angle and appearance according to the image shoot for a good illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-9.jpg"                      alt="understand image perspective"                ></p><h3 id="2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties-3"><a href="#2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties"></a>2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties</h3><p>It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won’t tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-10.jpg"                      alt="blend text with image properties"                ></p><h3 id="3-Look-for-Negative-Space-3"><a href="#3-Look-for-Negative-Space-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Look for Negative Space"></a>3. Look for Negative Space</h3><p>When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering. Often referred to as negative space, utilizing that space for the text may be the perfect way that you can consider writing a text on photos. This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-11.jpg"                      alt="add text in negative space"                ></p><h3 id="4-Framing-the-Text-3"><a href="#4-Framing-the-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Framing the Text"></a>4. Framing the Text</h3><p>If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-12.jpg"                      alt="frame the text"                ></p><h3 id="5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles-3"><a href="#5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Control your Sizes and Styles"></a>5. Control your Sizes and Styles</h3><p>Make sure that you always select a font size or style that is relevant to the photo. The use of inappropriate sizes and styles in photos takes away the essence of the picture. A balance across these traits is essential for the user to bring. Capture the viewers’ attention without compromising the quality of the photo itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-13.jpg"                      alt="select accurate font size and style"                ></p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The best illustration of images is not possible without adding typography to them. People add text to the images to share social media posts or create poster events.

To the convenience of many, especially those involved with VR, it now comes with an improved workflow for editing virtual reality videos. While you will be required to use your favorite tools to stitch videos together for a 360 degree view, Adobe Premier Pro allows for the importation of such videos with an equirectangular projection that makes it possible to edit them just as you would work with any other video file.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Stitch GoPro Clips into 360 Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Editing-360-degrees-videos-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Editing-360-degrees-videos-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Editing 360 degrees videos in Premiere Pro"></a>Editing 360 degrees videos in Premiere Pro</h2><p> Consider the following steps when editing 360 degree videos using Premiere Pro from Adobe-:</p><h4 id="1-Import-your-360-footage"><a href="#1-Import-your-360-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Import your 360 footage"></a>1. Import your 360 footage</h4><p> After starting the application, the first step towards editing your videos is to import your footages into the application. Premiere Pro allows you to import equirectanglular video footages, which are just like the normal footages. To import your footages into the application, double click on the project panel or simply click Command + I.</p><h4 id="2-Adjust-your-settings"><a href="#2-Adjust-your-settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust your settings"></a>2. Adjust your settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-editing-settings.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Settings"                ></p><p> Premiere Pro allows you to view any video by double clicking on the video in the project panel. Be default, the equirectanglular video clips will appear on the preview panel, but they will be distorted. To change how the videos appear on the preview panel, it is imperative to adjust the settings. This is done by clicking on the wrench icon located at the bottom right of window then navigating to VR Video&gt;Settings. This will pull up the menu to let you adjust the various settings you need to proceed with the editing.</p><h4 id="3-Set-the-Preview-Window-to-VR-Mode"><a href="#3-Set-the-Preview-Window-to-VR-Mode" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the Preview Window to VR Mode"></a>3. Set the Preview Window to VR Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-vr-mode.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Enable VR mode"                ></p><p> After you have established the right settings for your project, the next thing you need to do is to set the preview window into VR Mode. There are two ways to do this and they include-:</p><ul><li>Click the wrench icon and choose Video &gt; VR Mode or,</li><li>From the button menu, select the VR Mode button, which can also be found by selecting the “+ icon”</li></ul><p> To navigate around the preview window in the VR Mode, use the sliders along the edges of the frame or simply click and drag when you are inside the frame. You should be familiar with these settings and actions if you have had some experience with YouTube VR in the past.</p><h4 id="4-Edit-your-footage"><a href="#4-Edit-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit your footage"></a>4. Edit your footage</h4><p> After importing your footage and adjusting the settings as well as setting the preview window into VR Mode, you are now ready to begin the actual editing of the 360 degree video in Premier Pro. In as much as VR editing sounds like a new phenomenon in video creation, it shouldn’t be viewed any differently from working with a video footage in the timeline. As long as the video footage remains equirectangular, you will be able to trim, slice and add color to the footage just as you would do when working with the normal videos. However, don’t forget that transformational effects such as warp stabilizer will not be available for your 360 video.</p><h4 id="5-Exporting-the-VR-Footage"><a href="#5-Exporting-the-VR-Footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Exporting the VR Footage"></a>5. Exporting the VR Footage</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-vr-footage.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Export VR footage"                ></p><p> A while back, exporting VR footages to YouTube was possible only through third party applications. But now, such capabilities have been included in Adobe Premiere Pro and you can now apply all the Meta data directly inside the application.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors.

The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors.

The options available back then were very rudimentary compared to what we have at the present times, thanks to advancements in technology as well as the phenomenon growth in the photography industry. Not long ago, the term video camera was used to encompass just a handful of devices which all had similar characteristics. But nowadays, there are many types of video cameras at all budget levels, shapes and sizes and presented below is a quick overview of the types of video cameras available in the market today:</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 professional 360 degree cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is Frame Rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What Is Video Format <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</p><h2 id="1-Smartphone"><a href="#1-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smartphone"></a>1. Smartphone</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-dual-camera.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone video camera"                ></p><p> Smartphone with inbuilt video cameras are at the very bottom of video camera food chain. Most of the high-end Smartphones such as some Android, iPhone, and Nokia models have satisfactory video cameras capable of shooting high definition videos. Even though the Smartphone video cameras may not suffice the needs of individuals who are serious about film making, they are adequate enough for the average users who need to take videos and photos during instances such as family or social gatherings. With a growing set of apps and tools however, these cameras can now be equipped and made to operate like full size cameras capable of taking professional videos.</p><h2 id="2-Consumer-Video-Cameras"><a href="#2-Consumer-Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="2. Consumer Video Cameras"></a>2. Consumer Video Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consumer-camera-image.jpg"                      alt="Consumer video camera"                ></p><p> Consumer video cameras refer to simple cameras designed for personal non-professional use. In most cases, these cameras are less expensive and can be bought in the range of <strong>$200</strong> to <strong>$1,500</strong> and they usually come with smaller imaging chips. The images from consumer video cameras are not as great in terms of quality as the images from a professional camera.</p><p> The other characteristic of consumer cameras is that they are smaller and simpler to operate, with most of them being fully automatic. But users still have the versatility to manually adjust other settings such as exposure audio level, focus and white balance amongst others. Unlike their professional counterparts, consumer cameras don’t have extensions to allow for extra audio inputs for professional sound equipment and all of them have fixed lenses with outdated digital revolution.</p><h2 id="3-Pro-Consumer-Video-Camera"><a href="#3-Pro-Consumer-Video-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3. Pro Consumer Video Camera"></a>3. Pro Consumer Video Camera</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/prosumer-video-camera.jpg"                      alt="Prosumer camera"                ></p><p> Next in the list are pro consumer video cameras. Pro consumer cameras lie in between consumer cameras and professional cameras. They are the cameras with smaller form factors than the larger cameras which are usually mounted on the shoulders for big budget TV production. However, the cameras are packed with enough features to grant professional image quality and are sufficient to do just any job.</p><p> Pro consumer video cameras are also fairly expensive and the decent ones range between $1500 and $10,000 – almost a third of what you could spend for fully professional cameras like those used for big budget television works. Despite the high price range and the kind of technology utilized in the manufacture of these cameras, they still come with manual image and audio controls and most of them have external audio inputs.</p><p> The other admirable thing about these cameras is that they offer bigger imaging chips, interchangeable lenses, as well as the versatility to be time code in and out in instances of multi-camera reporting. With all the features and capabilities of these cameras, it becomes really difficult to distinguish them as either pro consumer cameras or professional cameras. Perhaps the most glaring difference between the two sets of cameras is the price. For professional video cameras, you can expect to spend anywhere from $8,000 well up to the regions of $50,000 and sometimes beyond.</p><h2 id="4-Super-Chip-Cameras"><a href="#4-Super-Chip-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. Super Chip Cameras"></a>4. Super Chip Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-chip-camera.jpg"                      alt="Super chip video cameras"                ></p><p> Yet again, there is a set of cameras in between the pro consumer cameras and the professional cameras and we prefer to call them super chip cameras. These cameras are characterized by three distinct factors below:</p><ul><li>Super chip cameras all have imaging chips which are larger than traditional pro video cameras. The imaging chips in these cameras are two to three times bigger than those in traditional pro video cameras.</li><li>The second factor distinguishing the super chip video cameras is the fact that they come with interchangeable lenses.</li><li>The third distinguishing factor is the price of the super chip cameras.</li></ul><p> Super chip cameras are primarily packed with big chips and professional features and they are also relatively affordable than the professional cameras. The cost of super chip cameras could be anywhere between <strong>$6,000</strong> and <strong>$20,000</strong>. Some examples of the super chip cameras include some brands of Sony, Cannons Compact and the powerful Panasonic F100 video camera.</p><p> These cameras have the capability to do everything that a traditional program could do, but with the added advantage of achieving the same tasks at relatively affordable rates. They are also ideal for high-end freelance broadcast work and film making.</p><h2 id="5-DSLR-Video-Cameras"><a href="#5-DSLR-Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="5. DSLR Video Cameras"></a>5. DSLR Video Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera-full-rig.jpg"                      alt="DRSL video camera"                ></p><p> DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) is basically digital photo camera fitted with the ability to take high quality HD videos. The popularity of these cameras has grown in the past few years due to three outstanding characteristics below common to all DSLR cameras:</p><ul><li>They have big imaging chips which lead to high quality images.</li><li>They have interchangeable lenses which allow for more creative flexibility, making it possible for you to use first-class lenses if you can afford.</li><li>DSLR cameras are affordable. For instance, with about $3,000 you can purchase a DSLR camera with double image quality considering that this is half of what you would have paid for a dedicated pro consumer video camera.</li></ul><p> At the look of things, it may appear that DSLR cameras is the way to go, considering its features as well as the fact that they are more affordable. However, there are certain limitations you may not like about them. For instance, DSLR cameras are still photo cameras. They were never designed for video and this was an afterthought in their design.</p><p> Again, you will be disappointed to learn that most of the important features presented even on the low video cameras are missing in these cameras. The features absent in DLSR include manual audio control, zebra stripes for judging exposure, speaking to judge focus, and motorized zoom.</p><p> Additionally, DSLR cameras don’t have an XLR audio inputs to allow the use of professional mics and mixes and they also have a limited recording time of just 12 minutes per clip and this is not very encouraging if you are in the middle of recording someone’s wedding vows. Even though there are a number of workarounds and third party applications to help in overcoming these shortcomings, they will only add to the cost and complications of DSLR shooting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premier-pros-pathway-to-perfect-sound-cutting/"><u>2024 Approved  Premier Pro's Pathway to Perfect Sound Cutting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/canon-camera-insights-for-stunning-time-lapse-vids-for-2024/"><u>Canon Camera Insights for Stunning Time-Lapse Vids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-essential-8-web-destinations-for-3d-text-psd-sharing-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential 8 Web Destinations for 3D Text PSD Sharing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-the-frontier-of-gesture-based-technology-advancements-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Frontier of Gesture-Based Technology Advancements for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-from-still-to-moving-adding-animated-effects-to-your-text-ig-stories/"><u>[New] From Still to Moving  Adding Animated Effects to Your Text IG Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-spotlight-on-premium-360cameras-for-professionals/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Spotlight on Premium 360°Cameras for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/ideal-14-visual-effects-with-text-animations/"><u>Ideal 14 Visual Effects with Text Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-the-perfect-virtual-space-with-zooms-features/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting the Perfect Virtual Space with Zoom's Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-writers-journey-through-podcast-production/"><u>2024 Approved  The Writer's Journey Through Podcast Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-from-silence-to-significance-replying-in-discord-chats-for-2024/"><u>[New] From Silence to Significance  Replying in Discord Chats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-from-snaps-to-savings-on-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  From Snaps to Savings on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-thriving-in-the-youtube-ecosystem-backlink-building-essentials/"><u>2024 Approved  Thriving in the YouTube Ecosystem  Backlink Building Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-easy-to-use-frp-bypass-tools-for-unlocking-google-accounts-on-poco-x5-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 10 Easy-to-Use FRP Bypass Tools for Unlocking Google Accounts On Poco X5 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-fortune-in-focus-5-best-maps-for-treasures-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fortune in Focus  5 Best Maps for Treasures for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/buddy-up-virtuals-metaverses-best-10-for-2024/"><u>Buddy Up Virtuals  Metaverse's Best 10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/file-format-and-extension-of-filename-dont-match-in-excel-2007-file-by-stellar-guide/"><u>File Format and Extension of filename dont Match in Excel 2007 File</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-steps-for-stubborn-printer/"><u>Troubleshooting Steps for Stubborn Printer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-iphone-12-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Upgrade iPhone 12 without Data Loss? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-vivo-t2-pro-5g-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Vivo T2 Pro 5G PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image. Several factors can lead to blurred images, including slow shutter speeds, long focal lengths, and unsteady hands. Smart extrapolation detects the blurry path and sharpens the image at those points. Besides controlling sharpening for different areas of an image, the Filter’s interface also lets you override Photoshop’s auto-analysis. Want to use the photoshop shake reduction effect? Just follow the steps given below:</p><h3 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1\"></a>Step 1\</h3><p>First of all, open the image in photoshop on which you want to apply shake reduction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-1.jpg"                      alt="how to use shake reduction in photoshop"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2\"></a>Step 2\</h3><p>Now click on the filters option from the top menu, select sharpen, and then select shake reduction. Go to Filter&gt; Sharpen &gt; Shake Reduction</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-2.jpg"                      alt="use shake reduction in photoshop"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3\"></a>Step 3\</h3><p>The Shake Reduction dialogue box shows the Preview of the image as Photoshop automatically de-blurs the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-3.jpg"                      alt="use shake reduction in photoshop - Preview the Image"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4\"></a>Step 4\</h3><p>You can fine-tune the blue reduction in the Shake Reduction dialogue box as Photoshop’s automatic detection can introduce unwanted artifacts.</p><h3 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5\"></a>Step 5\</h3><p>When Photoshop detects moving pixels, it places a selection rectangle on that region. With the Blue Estimation tool for Photoshop, you can resize and reposition the box around the image to focus on more areas. As Photoshop selects areas of the image, “blue traces” are created, and the Filter is applied.</p><h3 id="Step-6"><a href="#Step-6" class="headerlink" title="Step 6\"></a>Step 6\</h3><p>The blur correction can be controlled using the advanced control sliders. By adjusting the Blur Trace Bounds slider, you can adjust the area used to trace the blur. Also, moving the sliders to the left will increase Smoothness and Artifact Suppression.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/shake-reduction-photoshop-4.jpg"                      alt="use shake reduction in photoshop - Adjust setting"                ></p><p>In order to minimize blockiness in the image, it is essential to check the Preview and select Artifact Suppression. A comprehensive walkthrough of how to use Shake Reduction commands is available on Adobe’s support site.</p><p>Though camera shake may make your photos look less impressive, it may bring something new to your videos. That’s why popular video editors have built-in camera shake effects for editors to add to their videos. If you are looking for a video editor like this, I would recommend Filmora for you.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shake reduction</strong> is a neat little feature that has a few quirks, one being the fact that it doesn’t seem to work very well if you’re already zoomed in on your image when you try to reduce camera shake. If there’s any hope of getting this feature to work for these images, you’d have to zoom back out and try reducing camera shake again. Some might find this frustrating, but it’s necessary if you’re trying to alleviate a lot of blur in your images.</p><p><strong>●</strong>Photoshop Shake Reduction is really useful when you want to reduce the shake and blurriness caused by the slow shutter speeds that camera phones inherently use. It’s quite simply a great feature for those who only shoot with their smartphones, but if you can afford a better camera, we would recommend using a tripod instead - it will always be better than Photoshop Shake Reduction.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Is <strong>Shake Reduction</strong> in Photoshop useful?

In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-1"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-1" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry.

A comprehensive walkthrough of how to use Shake Reduction commands is available on Adobe’s support site.</p><p>Though camera shake may make your photos look less impressive, it may bring something new to your videos. That’s why popular video editors have built-in camera shake effects for editors to add to their videos. If you are looking for a video editor like this, I would recommend Filmora for you.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shake reduction</strong> is a neat little feature that has a few quirks, one being the fact that it doesn’t seem to work very well if you’re already zoomed in on your image when you try to reduce camera shake. If there’s any hope of getting this feature to work for these images, you’d have to zoom back out and try reducing camera shake again. Some might find this frustrating, but it’s necessary if you’re trying to alleviate a lot of blur in your images.</p><p><strong>●</strong>Photoshop Shake Reduction is really useful when you want to reduce the shake and blurriness caused by the slow shutter speeds that camera phones inherently use. It’s quite simply a great feature for those who only shoot with their smartphones, but if you can afford a better camera, we would recommend using a tripod instead - it will always be better than Photoshop Shake Reduction.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ace-crews-the-quintessential-list-of-photo-vids-plus-music-maestros/"><u>2024 Approved  Ace Crews  The Quintessential List of Photo Vids + Music Maestros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/2024-approved-are-earnings-linked-to-assessing-merchandise/"><u>2024 Approved  Are Earnings Linked to Assessing Merchandise?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-transformative-power-in-healthcare-through-vr/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Transformative Power in Healthcare Through VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/celebrating-maker-spirits-creative-otu-packs/"><u>Celebrating Maker Spirits  Creative OTU Packs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-examining-the-elite-the-top-10-pc-vr-headsets-of-now/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Examining the Elite  The Top 10 PC VR Headsets of Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-finding-the-best-replacement-for-magixs-acid-pro/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Finding the Best Replacement for Magix's ACID Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-hurry-up-crafting-a-simple-google-photo-mosaic/"><u>[Updated] Hurry Up!

Even though it might be a little strange to have such a definition in a device that can easily fit in your pocket, the truth is that there’s nothing like a 4K video. If you think about it for a while, the first phones didn’t even have <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >a camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the first place. However, a lot of people thought this new trend wasn’t going to be popular at all, you just see everyone taking selfies, photographing their meals, using their <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >smartphones to capture the best moments of their lives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>With more and more people using their smartphones to take photos and shooting videos, the best brands in the market just had to make sure this feature would be included on their most expensive models. You can even buy a smartphone that allows you to shoot “raw” images and then you’re the only one taking care of the entire image processing.</p><p>So, what are the <strong>best 4K camera phones</strong> in the market? Which one should you choose?

The Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with a front camera of 13MP and a back camera of 19MP. One of the best things about their camera is that it is one of the very few that allows you to take a photo like if you were using a real camera. Overall speaking, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium camera is quite easy to use and it does offer a good experience. However, what we notice is that there are some things that don’t even make sense. One of them is the fact that although they include the 4K technology and this is a top feature that only the best smartphones have, the 4K appears as a special mode just like the creative effects or the AR. Their camera has an amazing feature that we loved: it is able to record slo-mo video at only 980 frames per second. With this kind of camera, you can even film a nature documentary because it will catch all the details. However, we also need to tell you this up-front: you do need a good light.</p><p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Sony Xperia XZ Premium 4K Smartphone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Huawei-P10"><a href="#2-Huawei-P10" class="headerlink" title="2.

And now, you can take advantage of their amazing cameras. The Huawei P10 comes with one front camera with 8Mp and two back cameras: one with 12MP and another one with 20MP. Just like it already happened with the previous Huawei models, you can use the 20MP one to take black-and-white photos. However, when you use both rear cameras, your photos will have a better clarity. Although the Huawei P10 comes with the feature that allows you to shoot 4K videos, the fact is that it doesn’t offer any <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when you’re recording at this resolution. As if this wasn’t enough, if you use Windows, you won’t be able to open them by using Windows’s 10 Photos app, VLC, and you won’t even be able to upload it directly to YouTube. Another thing that we notice is that the Huawei P10 camera doesn’t deal very well with low light. Even though you’ll have fun playing with the different modes of the Huawei P10 camera, the truth is that there are better smartphone cameras in the market these days.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Huawei P10 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8"><a href="#3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8" class="headerlink" title="3.

So, we weren’t really expecting anything less than that. The Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with a front camera with 8Mp and a rear camera with 12Mp. In what concerns to the menu itself, although you will only see the main icons on the screen, they included a lot of features that you can use. The Samsung Galaxy S8 camera works very well in the outdoors. The photos are sharp and show a lot of details and textures. And one of the main reasons why they achieve this major success is because their camera is using the HDR as default. Plus, since they also include the electronic stabilization, this ensures that your photos will be great even though you shake or the light is a bit low. In case you’re serious about shooting 4K videos, you need to know that the sound quality is not the best in the market and that you might have a few problems with the hybrid stabilization system. However, the Samsung Galaxy S8 camera still is one of the best in the market.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Galaxy S8 4K Smartphone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Google-Pixel-XL"><a href="#4-Google-Pixel-XL" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Google Pixel XL includes a front camera with 8Mp and a rear camera with 12.3Mp. Although you might find some excessive sharpness on some of your photos, most people seem to like it. One of the things that allow the Google Pixel XL to remain as one of the best on the market until today is the fact that the smartphone features the Snapdragon 821. And since it is so powerful, the Google Pixel XL is able to run HDR+ all the time. If there is something we love about the Google Pixel XL camera is the ability it has to combine different “raw” images and produce a high-quality JPG without any ghosting or blurring. In the 4K videos, you can count with some pretty smooth and nice videos although it doesn’t include optical stabilization. The difference is that Google chose to use gyro-based stabilization instead. The Google Pixel XL camera also works pretty well not only with low light photos as well as selfies that come with a lot of detail.</p><h4 id="5-LG-G6"><a href="#5-LG-G6" class="headerlink" title="5.

Plus, you can shoot 4K videos with the one that you choose. One of the best things about the LG G6 is the fact that it is water-proof. So, if you like outdoor activities, you can take some photos or shoot videos in the rain or around the pool. However, the LG G6 isn’t easy to mount and it’s not rugged, making it a bit difficult to use when compared with other smartphones on the market. Overall, the camera of the LG G6 isn’t that good. Although you can take pretty good photos in bright light and the phase detection autofocus is pretty accurate and quick, you won’t have any depth effect. So, you’ll always see some kind of blurring in the background. In case you decide to use the wider lens, you should expect to see some kind of distortion. However, what we really don’t like is the lack of detail on the photos. However, if you decide to take a photo in a low light environment, the quality of the images is quite remarkable. Although you’ll still see some noise, they are quite good. In what concerns to 4K videos, we can only say they are ok. Although the audio is great, there is no stabilization on the LG G6. So, if you’re shooting something that is moving quickly you won’t even get an ok 4K video.</p><h4 id="6-OnePlus-5"><a href="#6-OnePlus-5" class="headerlink" title="6. OnePlus 5"></a>6. OnePlus 5</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/oneplus-5-4k-phone.jpg"                      alt="OnePlus 5 4K Phone"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0732YHKBX/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0732YHKBX&linkId=abebbdc69a97ac3dc59dbf2c32243a8e" >Check OnePlus 5 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The OnePlus 5 comes with a double rear camera - one with 16Mp and the other one with 20Mp, and a front camera with 16Mp. When you’re taking photos in a low light, they will be incredibly detailed and sharp. Even though the OnePlus 5 doesn’t have any stabilization, as long as you’re taking a photo to a non-moving subject and you keep your hands steady, you can expect great results. Even though the lack of stabilization doesn’t affect photos very much, the truth is that affects the quality of your 4K videos a lot. This is, indeed, one of the main weaknesses of the OnePlus 5. In what concerns the front camera, the OnePlus 5 features one of the highest resolutions we have seen so far on the market. So, if you’re planning to take out many selfies, you can be sure the OnePlus 5 is perfect for you. One of the things we most like about the OnePlus 5 camera is their app interface. It’s simple, intuitive, and easy to use. You can play with all the settings you want with ease. The only drawback is really the video.</p><h4 id="7-HTC-U11"><a href="#7-HTC-U11" class="headerlink" title="7. HTC U11"></a>7. HTC U11</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/htc-u11-design.jpg"                      alt="HTC U11 4K Phone"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07144ZQ87/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07144ZQ87&linkId=904935237c80d28c01866b82ef2345aa" >Check HTC U11 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>When you’re looking for a smartphone that has a great camera, one of the things that you really need to look at is how are the images they produce with low light. And in what comes to this, the HTC U11 is definitely the winner. Featuring a front camera with 16Mp and a rear camera with 12Mp, the HTC U11 is perfect if you like to take “normal” photos. Since it includes the “dual-pixel” feature (just like the Samsung S8) that allows you to quickly focus, you can view them in every screen size that they will look amazing. In what concerns to video, although the default is set to 1080p, you can easily select the 4K option. One of the good things is that the HTC U11 includes image stabilization; one bad thing is that it doesn’t really work well when you’re using the 4K resolution (it works best when you’re using the default resolution - 1080p). Overall, the HTC U11 doesn’t disappoint at all. Yes, it could be better, especially in what concerns with 4K video shooting. However, the photos you get, especially with low light, are pretty amazing.</p><h4 id="8-Xiaomi-Mi6"><a href="#8-Xiaomi-Mi6" class="headerlink" title="8. Xiaomi Mi6"></a>8. Xiaomi Mi6</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xiaomi-m6-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="Xiaomi M6 4K Phone"                ></p><p>One of the most attractive things about the Xiaomi Mi 6 is the price. It’s about half of most of the smartphones featured on this list and their features aren’t half for sure. Many people tend to say that the Xiaomi Mi 6 is the replica of the iPhone 7 Plus. Well, you can say that considering the cameras that are identical on both phones. Just like the iPhone 7 Plus, the Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with an 8Mp front camera and a dual rear camera with 12Mp each. The one camera that doesn’t have anything to do with iPhone’s camera is the front one. It does, indeed have some different features. You can use a configurable tilt-shift mode, for example, that will make things look just like miniature models. In what concerns with the rear cameras, the Xiaomi Mi 6 does a great job with photos where there is good light. They are pretty sharp and very detailed. However, one of the things that should come as standard is the HDR. You will need to activate it when you want to use it which is not that good. Plus, it seems the hardware of the Xiaomi Mi 6 doesn0t have the ability to work with such a mode often since the app might crash. Both the depth effect and the zoom lens seem to work pretty well when there is a good light. If there was one thing that really surprised us was the quality of the photos with low lightning. It actually resembles the HTC U11 which is a great compliment. However, when it comes to video, regretfully, the Xiaomi Mi 6 fails completely. The Xiaomi Mi 6 doesn’t have any stabilization and the footage isn’t detailed or crisp. Plus, the sound isn’t good as well. Summing all up, even though the Xiaomi Mi 6 may be great taking great photos either with bright and low lights, the fact is that you shouldn’t consider it if you’re planning on shooting 4K videos.</p><h4 id="9-iPhone-7-Plus"><a href="#9-iPhone-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="9. iPhone 7 Plus"></a>9. iPhone 7 Plus</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="iPhone 7 Plus 4K Phone"                ></p><p>Featuring a 7Mp camera in the front and 2 back cameras, both with 12Mp, the iPhone 7 Plus was the first Apple smartphone to include 2 cameras in the back. The only feature added to the camera of the iPhone 7 Plus is the telephoto lens. This feature allows you to have a 2x optical zoom and it works pretty well. However, rather than that, the features continue to be all the same that was already included on the previous versions of the iPhone. One of the things that we really don’t like is the fact that the video resolution settings aren’t where they were supposed to be. Instead, you need to open the Setting’s app of the smartphone and scroll until you find the Photos &amp; Camera. Other than this, we are quite happy with the iPhone experience. The main camera photos are absolutely great in terms of color accuracy, sharpness, focus, and contrast. After all, it enables the HDR by default and it works pretty quickly. In what concerns to 4K videos, we are happy to say that they are detailed and sharp, just like the photos we already mentioned. The audio is high-quality and the stabilization is impressive. But not all is good with the iPhone 7 Plus camera. Low light photos may show you a low-quality level, especially when compared with these top smartphones. They will look very noisy.</p><h4 id="10-MOTO-Z2-Play"><a href="#10-MOTO-Z2-Play" class="headerlink" title="10. MOTO Z2 Play"></a>10. MOTO Z2 Play</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/moto-z2-play-4k-phone.jpg"                      alt="Moto Z2 Play 4K Phone"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073SBYMK7/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B073SBYMK7&linkId=8688020d43707610af045a46cdb025ad" >Check MOTO Z2 Play at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Featuring a 5MP camera on the front and a 12Mp camera on the back, we can say that the photos taken with the MOTO Z2 Play are among average. While the rear camera includes phase detection autofocus, dual-pixel autofocus, laser autofocus, and a dual-tone LED flash, this should imply that low light photos would have an awesome quality. However, this is not always the case since you sometimes, just need to keep tapping to focus what you want. One of the things we noticed was the difference when you’re looking at the photos on the smartphone itself and on another device. The truth is that they look a lot better on the AMOLED screen of the MOTO Z2 Play. When you’re trying to take a photo with low light, the auto night mode will activate. Again, the results weren’t always good or always bad. They kept changing. In what concerns video capabilities, the MOTO Z2 Play allows you to shoot using Full-HD or 4K. Although the videos could be a lot better, they are quite ok. Besides, one of the things that you can easily do is to use the Go Live mode and go live directly on YouTube.</p><p>Check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MOTO Z2 Play 4K Smartphone Complete Review &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Recommended-Video-Editor-App-for-Your-New-4K-Camera-Phones"><a href="#Recommended-Video-Editor-App-for-Your-New-4K-Camera-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Video Editor App for Your New 4K Camera Phones"></a>Recommended Video Editor App for Your New 4K Camera Phones</h2><p>After unboxing your favorite 4K camera phone, it is time to install various apps.

Which one has the best camera? Which one is the best to shoot 4K videos? There isn’t a single model that is the best one to take photos and to shoot 4K videos. So, simply put, you need to prioritize your needs, what you really appreciate more, and choose the best smartphone for you according to that. However, what we can say is that, according to our opinion, if you’re looking for the best smartphone for low light photos, your best choice is the HTC U11. But if you intend to take most of your photos with good and vibrant light, then you should really go for the Samsung Galaxy S8. If your major need is concerned with 4K videos, there’s no question that your best choice at the moment is the Google Pixel.</p><hr><p><strong>Tips for capturing cinematic footage with your phone

This is because the default preview window of most editors can be too small to show all the flaws in your clips. For example, you may have missed a spot during the color correction, which you would have missed when using normal view. However, accessing the function varies with the software and your device’s operating system. Here is how to access premiere pro full screen preview from different devices.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?"></a>Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is one of a videographer’s best video editing software. This is because it offers you one of the largest libraries of creative and editing assets. Furthermore, you can work cross-platform through the Creative Clouds service.</p><p>Unfortunately, this becomes challenging for Windows and macOS users because of the operation difference between their devices. For example, the key names differ on each device’s keyboard. Windows Keyboards feature the CTRL key, and Apple offers the COMMAND key instead. As such, it is challenging to locate functions with HOTKEYS.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to access Premiere full screen preview on both devices.</p><h3 id="Windows-Users"><a href="#Windows-Users" class="headerlink" title="Windows Users"></a><strong>Windows Users</strong></h3><ol><li>Launch Adobe Premiere Pro from your device and open your project file.</li><li>Once all the clips load on their tracks, you begin editing with the suite of creative assets from the program library. Some of the edits you can do include applying color LUTS and green screen.</li><li>Then, tap the <strong>Play</strong> button or the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> key on your keyboard to preview your work.</li><li>To enable a large screen preview, press the Grave Key (represent by <strong>~</strong> on a Windows keyboard.

These varying border lines on your Monitor Panel help you determine which objects are out of frame. Unfortunately, the feature is unavailable on previews or export files. Regardless, it is an extremely useful feature for your post-production. Follow these steps to enable it in your projects.</p><ul><li>Launch Premiere Pro on your device and import your clip to the Monitor Panel.</li><li>Select the clip you want to edit and right-click on the screen.</li><li>Enable the Safe Margins option by checking the box beside its name.</li></ul><h2 id="Part2-What-If-Full-Screen-Preview-lags-heavily"><a href="#Part2-What-If-Full-Screen-Preview-lags-heavily" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?"></a>Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?</h2><p>So, you now know how to access Adobe Premiere Pro Full Screen Preview, but there is a problem. Your videos are not playing right, and you are wondering what to do. Here are a few solutions when you notice full screen preview is lagging</p><h3 id="1-Fix-your-video-rendering-and-playback-setting"><a href="#1-Fix-your-video-rendering-and-playback-setting" class="headerlink" title="1. Fix your video rendering and playback setting"></a>1. Fix your video rendering and playback setting</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is configured to utilize your device’s GPU for rendering. However, using the wrong video rendering and playback settings can cause your full screen preview to lag. Follow these steps to fix the problem.</p><ul><li>Tap on <strong>Project settings</strong> to open the settings menu.</li><li>Then, proceed to <strong>Renderer</strong> to view your current settings. You will find the option under video rendering and playback.</li><li>Choose your device’s GPU as the default option to activate GPU acceleration. In addition, you will need a compatible graphics processing unit to support this function.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Uncheck-the-Mercury-Transmit-Feature"><a href="#2-Uncheck-the-Mercury-Transmit-Feature" class="headerlink" title="2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature"></a>2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature</h3><p>Another reason for full screen preview lag is Mercury Transmit. The feature allows you to transmit your video to a secondary screen. However, it takes up valuable RAM, especially when you do not own a second monitor. Here is how to disable it.</p><ul><li>Open your program settings and proceed to the <strong>Playback</strong></li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Enable Mercury Transmit</strong> option in the resulting menu.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software"><a href="#3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software" class="headerlink" title="3. Always update your system hardware and software"></a>3. Always update your system hardware and software</h3><p>Sometimes your full screen previews may lag because you miss the latest updates. Typically, developers provide users with free regular updates to make their software run better. For example, Adobe Premiere Pro issues regular updates to fix bugs and provide you with more creative library content.</p><p>As such, ensure you have the <strong>Check For Updates</strong> function enabled in your programs. Kindly note the feature only works if your device has an active internet connection.</p><h3 id="4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution"><a href="#4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution" class="headerlink" title="4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution"></a>4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution</h3><p>It is not wrong wanting to preview your video at 4K resolution. However, this can cause the program to lag significantly, especially if your device has low specs. In addition, changing your preview’s playback resolution does not affect its export settings. Follow these steps to make the changes:</p><ul><li>Access the <strong>Playback Resolution</strong> menu of your video clip from the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Then, alternate between lower values until the video lag stops. Currently, you can lower your Premiere full screen preview playback resolution up to 1&#x2F;16 the original value.</li></ul><h2 id="Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?"></a>Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-6.jpg"                      alt="best alternative to premiere pro"                ></p><p>So, you have given up on Premiere Pro’s persistent problems.

Final Cut Pro is one of the most popular paid video editors that professional video creators recommend. Final Cut Pro is a paid software and you have to pay a hefty one-time fee for lifetime full access. Therefore, it is important that you know everything about Final Cut Pro before purchasing it.</p><p>We have done a complete review of Apple Final Cut Pro.

Finally, we have provided a better alternative to Final Cut Pro if you are not satisfied with FCP.</p><h2 id="1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. History of Final Cut Pro"></a>1. History of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>The journey of Final Cut Pro(FCP) began as an alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro. FCP was initially developed by Macromedia. The designer of FCP named Randy Ubillos used to work for Adobe Premiere previously. In 1998, Apple purchased the development team of Final Cut Pro. Hence, Macromedia FCP turned into Apple FCP.</p><p>The popularity of Final Cut Pro started to pick up in the early 2000s. A popular movie producer named Michael Bloom praised FCP to boost its popularity. The software did not crash even once during rendering a movie. Soon, the popular director Roger Avery became the spokesperson for Apple FCP. This encouraged video creators and producers to try out Final Cut Pro as a video editor.</p><p>The breakthrough came in 2002 when Final Cut Pro was awarded a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award. Final Cut Express was launched in 2003 at an affordable rate. But it was discontinued in 2011. This is because Apple launched Final Cut Pro X in April 2011.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X came with a new user interface and workflow. It was packed with loads of new features. Subsequently, new features such as effects, filters, color enhancement, and support for HDR and 360-degree video were introduced. This helped it to become one of the best video editors in the world.</p><h2 id="2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="2. Features of Final Cut Pro"></a>2. Features of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Final Cut Pro is a feature-rich video editor.

There is no doubt that a great text effect and a stunning text animation take video to the next level. Final Cut Pro has loads of text effects and presets that you can apply to enhance titles and captions. Starting from opening and ending crediting to lower-thirds and subtitles, there are presets for everything.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong>: Transitions are an integral part of video editing. Whenever there is a change of scenes, there has to be a transition effect. A transition prevents jump cuts and awkward scene shifting. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of transitions that will enhance your video content.</p><p><strong>Video Effects</strong>: There are over 300 video effects in Final Cut Pro. The more the video effects, the more popular the video editor becomes. But there is no point in having loads of video effects unless they can impactful.

Final Cut Pro supports the Chroma key by which you can remove the green screen background. You can replace it with anything starting from static background to dynamic background. Besides, you can add effects and animations to make it dramatic and cinematic.</p><p><strong>Audio Editing</strong>: Last but not least, the audio part of a video is extremely important.

It charges a one-time fee for lifetime full access. The one-time fee is $299.99 and there are no additional charges for future updates.</p><p>The one-time fee may seem massive but if you use FCP for a few years, it will become rather economical.

But, from a wide plethora of choices available on the internet to download for video editing, you could be confused regarding which one would be the best for you. That is why here in this article, we will talk about <strong>final-cut pro-plug-ins</strong> that can be downloaded from the internet free of cost or by paying.</p><p>If you are not aware of what plug-ins for final cut pro are. Then, let us take a brief look at them: - Third-party add-ons, called plug-ins, are tools used to enhance videos in final cut pro X. They can add new features to your final cut pro software that original developers didn’t include. Most plug-ins are created by ordinary people to enhance their work and are sometimes shared on the internet for free or at a fee.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Fx factory pro</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">mLUT</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Color Finale 2.0</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">NewBlueFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Movie Pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Motion blur plug-in</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Free data pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Distortion effects</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Shutter shock FCPX plug-in</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Part 2.

Fx factory pro</h3><p>Fx factory pro is one of the <strong>best final cut pro plug ins</strong> that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fx-factory-pro.jpg"                      alt="fx factory pro"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with <strong>fcpx plug-ins</strong>, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts.

That’s where the mLUT plug-in of motion VFX comes into the picture. Ideally, it is a free plug-in that video editors can use to look up their tables in one place together. One of the eye-catching features of mLUT from Motion VFX would ask your video to be shot in a longer format to get the best out of your color grading capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mlut-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="mlut plug in"                ></p><p>If you want to add more to your video editing, the paid version of mLUT packs offered by Motion VFX will allow you to add a cinematic look to your video efficiently. After all this, you find your video or image not perfect, so make sure you keep using it.</p><h3 id="3-Color-Finale-2-0"><a href="#3-Color-Finale-2-0" class="headerlink" title="3. Color Finale 2.0"></a>3. Color Finale 2.0</h3><p>Most people using final cut pro X were somewhat unsatisfied with the internally practical fast color correction tools. It was always about having something that properly allowed video color grading workflow. That is when color finale 2.0, a newer version of the initially released color finale, is known to come in handy. It is a new and more improved version of the previous one, which is optimized for having metal and more color management features such as ACES.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/color-finale-2-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="color finale 2 plug in"                ></p><p>From the beginning, the color finale was designed as a plug-in for the final cut pro-X. It offers the users two options: go for the standard one or pro to enjoy more features like tangent panel control, group grading, ACES color space, film grain simulation, and mask tracking.</p><h3 id="4-NewBlueFX"><a href="#4-NewBlueFX" class="headerlink" title="4. NewBlueFX"></a>4. NewBlueFX</h3><p>Suppose you are looking for a compatible video editing program like adobe after effects, premiere pro, and some other software like it. Then, a new blue FX that provides an alternative to critical aspects like framing, masking, and offering necessary plug-ins to improve the videos and eliminate other challenges could be the choice for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/new-blue-fx-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="new blue fx plug in"                ></p><p>There are many plug-ins offered in New blue fx, and each has features that push forward for its improvement every day. The zoom effects or auto-pan plug-in could be your solution when adding some still motion or picture into your video.

Movie Pop"></a>5. Movie Pop</h3><p>Do you consider you’re a crazy fan of movies, and being a video creator, you are always on the move on how to recreate those famous movie sequences that you watched in movie halls or on your computer?

Then, unfortunately, it won’t be able to offer you those because movie pop developed by stupid raisins was made for the above work only and nothing more. It is a free plug-in that editors can download from the internet.</p><h3 id="6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin"><a href="#6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="6.

The process is also quite simple:</p><ul><li>Entering the main title text</li><li>Adjusting the color density according to your specification</li><li>The text’s speed and ideal position</li></ul><p>After completing these above steps, your plug-in will be built automatically.</p><h3 id="7-Motion-blur-plug-in"><a href="#7-Motion-blur-plug-in" class="headerlink" title="7.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $7 2TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money.

Best price of unlimited cloud storage service"></a>2. Best price of unlimited cloud storage service</h3><p>For the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>The service offers one of the industry’s most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.</p><p>Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually</li><li>Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.</li><li>Enterprise plan – Custom pricing</li></ul><p><em><strong># Dropbox</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG"                      alt="dropbox"                ></p><p>It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><em><strong># Google Drive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free" class="headerlink" title="2.

TeraBox also guarantees ISO&#x2F;IEC-certified cloud security and offers “Locked Box” functionality for private cloud storage.</p><h3 id="3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest"><a href="#3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest" class="headerlink" title="3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

Best price of unlimited cloud storage service</h3><p>For the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>The service offers one of the industry’s most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.</p><p>Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually</li><li>Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.</li><li>Enterprise plan – Custom pricing</li></ul><p><em><strong># Dropbox</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG"                      alt="dropbox"                ></p><p>It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined.

Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk. A specialized application compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux takes things further by enabling you to explore your file system, preview documents, and stream your media files using an integrated player.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 10GB for free, 150GB - $1.67; 1TB - $4.17; and 5TB - $15</p><p><em><strong># Google Drive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-7.JPG"                      alt="googledrive"                ></p><p>There are six different membership levels available for Google One, the most basic of which provides 100GB of storage space for $2 per month. Using the Google One app, you can easily manage your account, switch between plans, free up storage space on your account, and take advantage of other exclusive member perks. If you go to the Google Drive website, you will discover that most of their plans are geared toward businesses and cost between $6 and $18 per month per user. Every business plan comes with a free trial period of fourteen days.</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong>: 15GB for free, 100GB - $7.49; 250GB - $10; and 500GB - $18.95 monthly</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-consider-other-than-price-when-choosing-cloud-storage-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?"></a>Part 3: What to consider other than price when choosing cloud storage services?</h2><p><strong>Cloud storage pricing</strong> is a vital factor when choosing a service. However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="1. How can I get 100GB for free?"></a>1. How can I get 100GB for free?</h3><p>Most cloud storage companies give customers free storage, such as 2GB, 5GB, or 15GB. Very few cloud storage services offer 100GB of free internet storage. As far as I’m aware, Degoo and CBackup are the storage companies that offer 100GB of free cloud storage, followed by Mega’s 50GB of free storage.</p><h3 id="2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1"><a href="#2-Where-can-I-get-1TB-of-cloud-storage-for-free-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

TeraBox also guarantees ISO&#x2F;IEC-certified cloud security and offers “Locked Box” functionality for private cloud storage.</p><h3 id="3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest-1"><a href="#3-Which-cloud-storage-is-the-cheapest-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?"></a>3. Which cloud storage is the cheapest?</h3><p>The least expensive 1TB of cloud storage is available from Icedrive for $4.17 per month when invoiced annually. Nevertheless, Sync.com 2TB plan, which costs $8 per month, provides a superior bargain. IDrive is the lowest option regarding online backup, offering 5TB for just $59.62 for the first year.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After comparing our best choices of <strong>GCP storage pricing</strong> for data storage, we hope you have all the details you require to make an informed decision.

This expression led to netizens using his image to express situations where the forced smile is masking your true feelings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photo-meme-3.jpg"                      alt="do stock image modeling"                ></p><p>Currently, Hide the Pain Harold has over 300,000 followers across all platforms.

It features the stock photo meme guy looking at another woman’s backside while walking with his girlfriend. In addition, the models’ facial expressions add to the photo’s impact. For example, the girlfriend shows her disapproval by staring at the man with her mouth open.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photo-meme-4.jpg"                      alt="distracted boyfriend"                ></p><p>The original photo is the work of Antonio Guillem, who uploaded it on iStock in November 2015. Initially, the photo was labeled as a lisloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl and required purchasing the proper license to use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stock-photo-meme-5.jpg"                      alt="original photo"                ></p><p>According to Meme Documentation, the first version of the Distracted boyfriend theme dates back to January 2017. Prog Snob, a Turkish progressive rock group on Facebook, posted the meme on their page to reference Phil Collin’s distraction from progressive rock by pop music. However, it was the August 2017 Twitter version referencing the youth’s feelings towards capitalism and socialism that went viral.</p><p>Since then, the meme continues to enjoy mass popularity, including:</p><ul><li>It won the Best Meme of 2017 at the 10th Annual Shorty Awards.

We capture multiple images of the same subject or a scene with slightly different exposure and then mix all the images into a final perfect photograph.</p><p>A portrait is one of the most liked genres of photography, especially on the occasions of weddings, get-togethers, meet-ups, and many more. A good portrait photograph can capture a person’s detailed personality and emotions.</p><p>The camera can perform fantastic functions, but it is still a machine at the end of the day, and its sensors have limitations. But by the HDR technique, you can create a scene closer to what the human eye sees.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn how to shoot and create impressive HDR portraits, whether a beginner or a professional. We have written about creating both still and moving HDR portraits in an easy way.</p><p>People often find it challenging to shoot a perfect HDR photograph from a phone camera. In this tutorial, we will answer some common questions on how to create an impressive HDR portrait. So let’s get started.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Still HDR Portraits</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Some Useful Tips to Remember</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">HDR Effects on Phone Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Moving HDR Portraits?</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot HDR Portraits?"></a>How to Shoot HDR Portraits?</h2><p>HDR portraits are best captured when your subject is still and the camera is also fixed on a tripod. So first, we will talk about how to shoot still portraits and then moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Still-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Still-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Still HDR Portraits"></a>Still HDR Portraits</h3><p>You can create a high-quality HDR portrait by following these simple steps.</p><h5 id="Step1Camera-Setting"><a href="#Step1Camera-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Step1Camera Setting"></a>Step1Camera Setting</h5><p>The first and most crucial part of your camera setting is to choose between two modes, i.e., manual or aperture mode. We have compared these two below so you can choose whichever way fits your situation.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Manual mode</strong></th><th><strong>Aperture Mode</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>In manual mode, you can control both aperture and shutter speed and select any desired value.</td><td>In this mode, you just have to select your desired aperture value, like <em>f</em>&#x2F;2.0 or <em>f</em>&#x2F;1.8, and the camera will automatically pick the suitable shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>It can be used when the lighting conditions are intense and constant, and you have plenty of time to think and adjust the exposure.</td><td>Useful when the light conditions are changing rapidly. It selects the best suitable exposure itself and has the advantage of speed.</td></tr><tr><td>You have more control over your camera settings.</td><td>The camera itself matches the aperture value with the appropriate shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>Suitable for professionals.</td><td>Suitable for beginners.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-1.jpg"                      alt="camera setting"                ></p><p>So it is your choice which mode you want to use. Both work perfectly with HDR photography.</p><h5 id="Step2Bracketing"><a href="#Step2Bracketing" class="headerlink" title="Step2Bracketing"></a>Step2Bracketing</h5><p>HDR photography uses the technique of bracketing in which multiple shots of the same subject are taken using different camera contrast settings and then merging these images to get a final result.</p><p>You can take numerous pictures manually by selecting a new exposure after every photo. Still, it is very time-consuming, and the chances of the subject moving during the shoot also increase.</p><p>So almost all DSLRs come with this beneficial feature of bracketing. You can check the user manual of your device to activate this feature. For some devices, it is started by a single click, while in some, it is hidden deep in the menu. Once you start it, you have to select the number of images you want to take and the increase in exposure after every snap.</p><p>Usually, three shots are ideal for HDR portraits as the chances of moving decrease. Nowadays, many latest DSLRs have the option of automatic exposure bracketing as it provides the photographer with different levels of exposure in a single click without spending valuable time adjusting camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-2.jpg"                      alt="moving decrease"                ></p><p>Once you are done with your bracketing settings, all you have to do is press and hold the shutter, and your specified number of photos will be taken, each with a different exposure value.</p><h3 id="Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember"><a href="#Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember" class="headerlink" title="Some Useful Tips to Remember"></a>Some Useful Tips to Remember</h3><ol><li><strong>Try to Keep the Subject Still</strong></li></ol><p>HDR portrait shooting takes time as you have to take 3-5 images of your subject. So you have to keep your subject still in every frame; otherwise, your final image will not be good.</p><p>To avoid moving, you can give them some support to lean on, like a wall, or ask them to sit on a chair.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid Shaking the Camera</strong></li></ol><p>Same is the case for your camera. You have to use a tripod stand to avoid camera shaking.</p><ol><li><strong>Autofocus should be OFF</strong></li></ol><p>You should adjust the focus manually instead of autofocus, as it may shift the focus accidentally while pressing the shutter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-3.jpg"                      alt="autofocus should be off"                ></p><h3 id="HDR-Effects-on-Phone-Camera"><a href="#HDR-Effects-on-Phone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="HDR Effects on Phone Camera"></a>HDR Effects on Phone Camera</h3><p>Of course, everyone can’t use a DSLR camera for shooting HDR portraits as the process is a bit difficult and requires some expertise. But you can achieve the same effects on your mobile phone. Many latest mobiles offer HDR features in their camera. Unlike the bracketing effect of professional cameras, mobile usually takes only one picture and then you can edit by using some third-party app. Hundreds of these photo editing apps allow you to change the brightness and contrast of your image to create a <em>“pseudo”</em> HDR image.</p><p>Now that you know how to shoot still HDR portraits, let’s put some light on shooting HDR moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Moving-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Moving-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Moving HDR Portraits?"></a>Moving HDR Portraits?</h3><p>People usually ask, “ <em>Can I shoot moving subjects in HDR?</em>“ or “<em>What is the basic method to get sharp-looking HDR photos of moving people?</em>“</p><p>Shooting moving portraits in HDR can get a bit difficult because of blurring and exposure issues. But you don’t need to worry because here are some of the effective solutions for recording moving HDR portraits.</p><p><strong>Solution 1.</strong> You can use two DSLRs with the same lens and set them so that the difference in the viewing angle is minimum.</p><p><strong>Solution 2.</strong> Using RAW files you can get a dynamic range of exposures that you wouldn’t be able to get with a JPEG file.</p><p><strong>Solution 3.</strong> DSLRs with high-quality exposure and depth sensors can also help shoot HDR moving portraits.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Merge-Images-to-Create-an-HDR-Portrait"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Merge-Images-to-Create-an-HDR-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?"></a>How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</h2><p>After you have shot the images, the next step is to merge and edit them on photoshop or any other software to create a single perfect portrait.</p><h5 id="Step1Merging-the-Images"><a href="#Step1Merging-the-Images" class="headerlink" title="Step1Merging the Images"></a>Step1Merging the Images</h5><p>Hundreds of editing software are available but here we are going to talk about photoshop as it is used worldwide and is user-friendly.</p><ul><li>First, when you open Photoshop, go to <strong>Files &gt;</strong> <strong>Automate &gt; Merge to HDR pro,</strong> Or click on <strong>Tools &gt; Photoshop &gt; Merge to HDR pro</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-4.jpg"                      alt="tools photoshop merge to hdr pro"                ></p><ul><li>Click on <strong>Browse</strong> and select the images you want to merge.</li><li>Before clicking the OK button, you can tick on the <strong>Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images</strong> option so that minor artifacts introduced while shooting the images can be removed by photoshop.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-5.jpg"                      alt="removed by photoshop"                ></p><ul><li>After the images are loaded, a dialogue box will appear on the right side with all the tools you need to edit your HDR portrait.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-6.jpg"                      alt="edit hdr portrait"                ></p><ul><li>Tick on the option of <strong>Remove ghosts</strong> to avoid any halos in the editing process.</li><li>For regular HDR portraits, select <strong>16 Bit</strong> mode in the first section.</li><li>The second section is <strong>Edge Glow</strong>. If you want a natural-looking portrait photo, you should decrease the <strong>Strength</strong> and <strong>Radius</strong> levels; otherwise, you can increase them according to your need.</li><li>Next, you have the <strong>Tone and Detail</strong> Reducing the <strong>Gamma</strong> adds more contrast to your image and vice versa. <strong>Exposure</strong> is simply the brightness of the image. The <strong>Detail</strong> option adds an HDR effect to your image, but you should avoid over-detailing as it may ruin the natural look of your portrait.</li><li>Finally, there is the option of <strong>Advanced</strong> and <strong>Curve,</strong> in which you can adjust the levels of <strong>Shadow</strong>, <strong>Highlights</strong>, <strong>Vibrance,</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> of your image.</li></ul><p>Once you are done with all the adjustments, you’ll finally have your perfect HDR portrait.</p><h5 id="Step2Editing-the-Portrait"><a href="#Step2Editing-the-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="Step2Editing the Portrait"></a>Step2Editing the Portrait</h5><p>If you are not satisfied with your resulting portrait image, you can further edit it in Lightroom or Photoshop.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>HDR portraits are way better than conventional portrait images as they bring out the photograph’s fine details that are impossible to achieve otherwise.</p><p>It is not as difficult as it seems to shoot an HDR portrait.
