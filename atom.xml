    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Final-Word-on-VegasPro-2019"><a href="#The-Final-Word-on-VegasPro-2019" class="headerlink" title="The Final Word on VegasPro 2019"></a>The Final Word on VegasPro 2019</h2><p>A fresh take on the traditional video editing program is VEGAS Pro 19. New name, new features, but is VEGAS still the same under the surface? VEGAS has always involved some dice-rolling. In our evaluation of VEGAS Movie Studio 17, the video editor received a definite 2.5-star average (the same goes for VEGAS Movie Studio 15).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vegas-pro-19.jpg"                      alt="vegas pro 19"                ></p><p>We criticized the software, saying that it was “not as good as the VEGAS name would have you believe.” Although some tools are incorporated in a very brilliant, innovative, and intuitive way, on the whole it feels too restricting away from your most basic demands. Your alternatives are restricted, or excessively concealed, overly complex, or unclear.</p><p>However, we are all still developing. In the same way, VEGAS Pro 19 offers a number of new tools that are suited for both novice and experienced video editors, even though it isn’t considered to be one of the best alternatives to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Color-grading"><a href="#Color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Color grading"></a>Color grading</h2><p>Changing the interface’s colors to make the experience better when editing is one thing, but it’s also good to</p><p>see that actual color correction has been improved as well.</p><p>The Grading Panel has been redesigned, like thinner looking range-limited color wheels, which give you more</p><p>control over the adjustments you’re making.</p><p>VEGAS also comes with 40 LUTs, and expanded individual R, G, B curves, among others, making color correction work more precise and enjoyable than before.</p><h2 id="Track-effects"><a href="#Track-effects" class="headerlink" title="Track effects"></a>Track effects</h2><p>Thankfully, not all of the links go to paid internet services. For your workflow, VEGAS Pro offers a number of great new additions. “Adjustment Tracks” is one of these. You can apply filters to entire tracks rather of needing to add them to individual segments.</p><p>By doing so, you may apply the same effects to numerous clips and manage their settings from a single area. Even better, you can keyframe these effects directly from the timeline to change their intensity over time. It’s simply some incredible visual effects software that wasn’t even imaginable previously in VEGAS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972670/19272" target="_top" id="1972670">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972670" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972670/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Scene-detection"><a href="#Scene-detection" class="headerlink" title="Scene detection"></a>Scene detection</h2><p>With version 19, VEGAS added a brand-new feature. They believe it to be so crucial that they have offered three options for doing it: split it whenever a cut occurs, examine finished, exported projects that you’ve brought back to the editing suite. Since we’ve been editing short films for almost 20 years, we haven’t needed to do it very often, but since we’re hoarders, most of our work are still accessible and editable. We become aware of how outnumbered we are as a result of this new characteristic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Upscale-options"><a href="#Upscale-options" class="headerlink" title="Upscale options"></a>Upscale options</h2><p>Upscaling is a fascinating advancement as well. The prior filter was getting on in years, but VEGAS has since unveiled a new AI-based one that performs far better. It claims to be able to transcode SD film (720x480) all the way up to 4K. (3840 x 2160). The filter has a straightforward slider; the higher you move it, the closer and more in-depth the clip will be with AI.</p><p>Naturally, the effects will be better the crisper and cleaner the source clip is. To be sure, the gadget is a surprising advancement, but one that is welcome. particularly when compared to earlier iterations of the video editing program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135361/19272" target="_top" id="2135361">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135361" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135361/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="VEGAS-Hub"><a href="#VEGAS-Hub" class="headerlink" title="VEGAS Hub"></a>VEGAS Hub</h2><p>The addition of the VEGAS Hub is one of the most noticeable visual changes. In both the form of a large login button at the top of the interface and a tab directly over the timeline.</p><p>VEGAS’ online presence is expanding, but the majority of the fun new features will only be available to subscribers. These days, it seems impossible to escape subscriptions; popular editors like Adobe Premiere Pro and Cyberlink PowerDirector both contain them. However, similar to PowerDirector, you have the option of subscribing or buying the software altogether.</p><p>One of these benefits is the capability to sync media between devices and save it online. It implies that moviemakers can use their smartphones to capture video, edit it, and then post it to the Hub. By the time you return to your editing station, those clips will be prepared.</p><p>Text to Speech, another intriguing subscription-only feature, speaks any sentences you provide it with using computer-generated voices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-points"><a href="#Price-points" class="headerlink" title="Price points"></a>Price points</h2><p>With the new “Automatic Scene Detection,” you no longer need to manually clip your file if you need to re-edit or use a project but no longer have access to the original material, only the finished product. Selecting the file from the Project Media folder and selecting “Detect Scenes and Add to Timeline” are two options for doing this. VEGAS examines it, makes edits, and inserts each segment in turn to the timeline where the playhead is situated.</p><p>The same thing may be accomplished by choosing the alternative option of “Detect Scenes and Create Subclips,” except that it won’t add anything to the timeline and will instead add subclips of each cut to your Project Media folder. The last item is “Scene Detection” under Video FX. You have certain customization choices with this filter that are not available with the other two approaches. You have access to three sliders that allow you to alter the cuts’ sensitivity.</p><p>Who else is transitioning to a subscription model? VEGAS is. But those who favor paying for a perpetual license haven’t yet been forgotten. VEGAS Edit costs $250, Pro costs $400, and Post costs $600. In actuality, this is less expensive than the prior iteration. The cost of a subscription is either $13, $20, or $30 each month.</p><p>The subscription model does offer benefits in addition to those already highlighted. For instance, Edit offers 20 royalty-free HD films and stock music samples for download each month along with 20GB of cloud storage.</p><p>With Pro, you have unlimited access to their material catalog, 50GB of additional online storage, VEGAS Stream streaming software, the top-notch Primatte chroma-keying program, and Sound Forge audio editing tools.</p><p>You get 100GB of cloud storage with Post, along with the photo editor VEGAS Image and the high-end visual effects compositing software VEGAS Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-beat-the-best-substitutes-for-samsungs-vr-camera-gear-360-for-2024/"><u>[New] Beat the Best Substitutes for Samsung's VR Camera Gear 360 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-exclusive-roundup-top-tier-no-cost-luts-available/"><u>[New] Exclusive Roundup Top-Tier, No-Cost LUTs Available</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-explore-the-latest-in-picsart-a-comprehensive-guide-and-review/"><u>[New] In 2024, Explore the Latest in PicsArt - A Comprehensive Guide and Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-therapeutic-effects-of-asmr-for-everyone/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Therapeutic Effects of ASMR for Everyone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-a-decade-of-innovation-in-online-cricket-streaming-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Decade of Innovation in Online Cricket Streaming for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensively-understanding-iphone-audio-acquisition/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensively Understanding iPhone Audio Acquisition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-the-glare-free-guide-to-stellar-gopro-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Glare-Free Guide to Stellar GoPro Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-tecno-spark-10-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Tecno Spark 10 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/connecting-with-shadows-deciphering-who-youre-actually-interacting-with-online-and-clarifying-ghostly-web-theories/"><u>Connecting with Shadows: Deciphering Who You're Actually Interacting With Online and Clarifying Ghostly Web Theories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/from-standard-to-spectacular-your-guide-to-choosing-a-high-res-screen/"><u>From Standard to Spectacular Your Guide to Choosing a High-Res Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/how-to-pick-a-perfect-virtual-reality-device-evaluating-portability-mobile-versus-connected-experience-for-2024/"><u>How to Pick a Perfect Virtual Reality Device Evaluating Portability (Mobile) Versus Connected Experience for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/24-affordable-advertising-streamlining-channel-sponsorship-partnerships/"><u>In 2024, Affordable Advertising Streamlining Channel-Sponsorship Partnerships</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/interaktionstexte-10-deutsche-grussformeln-ausserhalb-des-hallo/"><u>Interaktionstexte: 10 Deutsche Grußformeln Außerhalb Des 'Hallo'</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/shadowplay-recording-not-working-on-windows-try-these-proven-fixes/"><u>ShadowPlay Recording Not Working on Windows?

Is it worth buying a camcorder?"></a>1. Is it worth buying a camcorder?</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons for buying camcorders is the lens. With DSLRs and mirrorless cameras coming to the forefront, people doubt the credibility of a camcorder. But camcorders have powerful and long zoom lenses with tiny imaging sensors, which makes it more powerful than any DSLR. It also comes with variable speed zoom control that can create smooth, slow zooms to reveal and introduce a location, or quick punch-ins to highlight the action. There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels. Therefore, camcorders are a better and worthy purchase.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use"><a href="#2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use" class="headerlink" title="2.

One of its finest features is the ability to record meetings in order to capture every moment as a video. Using the Zoom app requires understanding how to convert ZOOM recordings to MP4 video format for free online. Zoom is a really practical technology that, as you undoubtedly well know, enables individuals to continue working or attending school despite the epidemic. If you have a Zoom recording, you undoubtedly have questions about how to get to the videos. Additionally, you must convert your Zoom recordings to mp4 if you detect that they are an unknown file format. However, Zoom recordings are immediately saved to your PC in MP4 format. However, sometimes the conversion is unsuccessful, leaving you with .Zoom files for your recordings. In this situation, you must convert the zoom recording to MP4.</p><p>One of its most intriguing features is the ability to record meetings in order to save every event as a film. One of the most important aspects of utilizing the Zoom app is learning how to convert a ZOOM video recording format to MP4 for free online. Zoom is a tool or software that enables several users to participate in a videoconference. It operates through meetings that attempt to replicate many of the activities we may perform at a meeting in person of any sort. Zoom allows you to record meetings, and after the meeting is over, it will begin to convert the recording to MP4. But a number of factors might lead this phase to fail. You may be wondering, “How do I convert a Zoom recording to MP4?” when you encounter the Zoom failed to convert recording problem. Thankfully, it’s a rather straightforward procedure that doesn’t need for any additional software. This article will demonstrate three different approaches for converting Zoom recordings to MP4 files. However, you must be the host of the meeting or have authorization to record it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App"><a href="#Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App"></a>Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App</h2><p>Zoom provides both local and cloud recording options. Users of the former may capture meeting video and audio thanks to its availability to both free and paid members. The latter allows paying subscribers to audio, video, and text-record the conference. Additionally, the recording file formats include TXT, MP4, and M4A. At the conclusion of a meeting, Zoom automatically transforms the raw video to an mp4 file. However, the video will be stored as a .zoom file if the operation is aborted. A.mp4 file that is an MP4 contains both audio and video data. M4A only has audio files in it. All MP4 files may be played using the M3U playlist file.

As a result, you are unable to record meetings anytime you want. A screen recording program from a third party, like Filmora from Wondershare, is the greatest answer to these issues. This professional program for Windows and Mac comes with a screen recording capability that enables you to record your screen activity in excellent definition, including zoom calls. Additionally, you have a variety of customizable recording options, including picture-in-picture, output format, frame rate, and quality.</p><p>The default Zoom recording is made in poor quality and offers no customizing options. Additionally, in order to record the meeting as a participant, you must have the host’s consent. MP4 is the ideal file type for saving Zoom meetings. This is due to the great compatibility of the MP4 format with a variety of hardware and media players. The MP4 format also provides high quality while being somewhat modest in size. Use Wondershare Filmora to get over these problems and capture Zoom meetings in excellent definition. The captured video may be transferred, compressed, and given further editing as required with this program.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>Steps to Record Zoom and Export the Video as Mp4 Format</strong></p><h5 id="Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora"><a href="#Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download and Install Filmora"></a>Step1Download and Install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>In the first step, visit the official website to download the latest version of Filmora for your PC.

Either the Windows installer or a download from the website may be used to install the program. By then, a recorded Zoom conference may be saved. Depending on the Zoom version you are using, there are really two methods to store your recordings. You can only store your recordings locally on your disk if you use Zoom’s free version. You may store your recordings both locally and to the Zoom cloud if you have a premium subscription, however. If the previous techniques didn’t work for you or you can’t locate your required meeting in the Recorded tab (this occurs when your meeting was recorded from a web browser), you might try the way below:</p><h5 id="Step1Run-the-zTscoder-Launcher-1"><a href="#Step1Run-the-zTscoder-Launcher-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Run the zTscoder Launcher"></a>Step1Run the zTscoder Launcher</h5><p>Click System and Security &gt; System in the Control Panel after opening it.

Therefore, choose a scene which is good enough to be tailored into the panoramic view.</li><li>For better shoot of vertical panorama on Android as well as iPhone, make sure to stand close to the subject to be captured. This way will intensify the tall subjects rather than giving more highlight to the foreground.</li><li>Leaving some space is another beautiful tip especially if you are a graphic designer and want to add some text into the picture.

The library contains 771 sky HDRI that are available to download with a single click upon signing up. The best part is that the website is ad-free, which means you can easily browse all the textures without these annoying ads trying to distract you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>If flexibility is your primary goal, Textures.com is a must-try. Upon signing up for a free account, it offers 15 credits each day to download HDRI and texture for your projects. The HDRIs are available at a low resolution, but with a premium subscription, you can download high-resolution images.</p><h3 id="Hdri-Skies"><a href="#Hdri-Skies" class="headerlink" title="Hdri-Skies"></a><a class="link"   href="https://hdri-skies.com/" >Hdri-Skies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-2.jpg"                      alt="hdri skies"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</p><p>Hdri-Skies is a premium website focusing on outdoors and open sky HDRI. It offers a magnificent collection of images differentiated in terms of time and location. It can be intimidating to choose a sky map from such a vast collection; therefore, the website offers filters to choose an HDRI from a specific moment of the day.</p><p>Signing up with a free account allows a free, instant 2k download. However, 20k high-resolution images are behind a paywall and require a premium subscription before you can download them. Hdri-Skies also has 28 volumes of payable full-spherical Skylum aurora hdr for professional use.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Keeping the website free of ads makes it easier to choose the perfect panorama. By giving free access to high-quality images, Hdri-skies is good enough for young digital artists who have just stepped into the field and looking for helpful resources.</p><h3 id="2G-Academy"><a href="#2G-Academy" class="headerlink" title="2G Academy"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.2gacademy.net/" >2G Academy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-3.jpg"                      alt="2g academy"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.7&#x2F;5</p><p>2G Academy is a group of Indonesian 3D artists working to step up the game of Architecture Visualization by offering free professional high-resolution Sky Hdr for 3D rendering.

Besides offering a vast library of sky hdri, 2G Academy also serves as an educational platform to learn 3D rendering with free youtube tutorials.

Offering a gamut of free sky hdri, 2G Academy is suitable for most needs of amateur and professional artists.</p><h3 id="3D-Art"><a href="#3D-Art" class="headerlink" title="3D Art"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/" >3D Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-4.jpg"                      alt="3d art"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.6&#x2F;5</p><p>Created and shared by 2g Academy, 3D Art has an ever-growing collection of high-quality HDRIs available for instant download. The site features over 100 impressive freebie sky HDRIs for commercial and non-commercial use.</p><p>The HDRI’s with the sun positioned at dawn, sunset, mid-day, and night allows artists to create 3D rendering at any time of the day. Providing a vast library of free resources, 3D Art is an excellent option for digital artists for their 3D Arch Viz Render. It offers free sky maps to any industry that needs to use sky hdri to improve lightning.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>If you want more HDRI, you can subscribe to the premium version. However, 3D Art can be annoying if website ads easily bug you. Nonetheless, the pros of this website easily outweigh its drawbacks.

All the photos are incredibly well-shot, with the sun at different angles in the sky.</p><p>HDR Maps features an impressive collection of more than 130 free HDR images that will help you get a broader range of colors in a single photograph. The best part about HDR maps is the wide range of 3D sky HDR images, which gives you many options to choose from. From mesmerizing skyline images with clouds to the sun setting or rising in a picturesque location, the images will surely wow you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>HDR maps also offer numerous other HDRI with time lapses and multiple textures. However, these images might make a dent in your wallet. HDR maps are free of any ads, making it easier to find the image you want, test it out and see if it is what you are looking for. The website is also very easy to navigate, and by using the tabs, you can quickly locate the type of image you want.</p><h3 id="HDR-Labs"><a href="#HDR-Labs" class="headerlink" title="HDR Labs"></a><a class="link"   href="https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/206948208/hdr-labs" >HDR Labs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-6.jpg"                      alt="hdr labs"                ></p><p>Rating 4.3 &#x2F; 5</p><p>HDR Lab is another website with some fantastic sky HDR images.

It contains all the tools and tutorials needed to start working on HDR images.</p><p>If it is your first time working on HDR images, we recommend starting here as the tutorial, plus the handbook guides you through the whole process. The images are not too complex, making them perfect for beginners. HDR lab will introduce you to the future of imaging, taking you step by step, especially for young digital artists.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>However, the website does not have a very intuitive interface, even though it is easy to navigate. The ads that pop up might get frustrating and distracting after a while. Apart from that, the images are directly downloaded into your computer without you first having a look at them, making it difficult to choose if you want to look at multiple pictures before deciding on one.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993654">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993654">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993654%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993654/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Poly-Haven"><a href="#Poly-Haven" class="headerlink" title="Poly Haven"></a><a class="link"   href="https://polyhaven.com/" >Poly Haven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/top-10-websites-for-sky-hdr-images-7.jpg"                      alt="poly haven"                ></p><p>Rating: 4.5&#x2F;5</p><p>Like the name, the website is an Poly haven for digital artists.

How to Edit the Video After Export from Funimate</h2><p>Editing videos is a difficult undertaking, particularly if you don’t have the right tools. Filmora is about as versatile as it gets when it comes to video editing software. Filmora is Wondershare’s entry-level, simple-to-use, high-quality video editing software. 4k and gif support are now standard capabilities for most video editing tools, but titles are something Filmora excels at. There are many excellent video editing programs available, but few of them provide the combination of ease of use and capability that Wondershare Filmora does. To begin video editing, you must first import movies from your PC.</p><p>Overall, we feel Filmora is one of the most mind-blowing premium options accessible, especially when combined with other video-related tools from the company. The solution enables you to share instances or gatherings with your colleagues, as well as independently record the sound and video of your framework. The Filmora video editor now supports true 4k videos (both 3840*2160 and 4096*2160), as well as the creation of proxy files for a more fluid video editing experience. In Filmora, you may edit with proxy video files and subsequently export with the full-sized resolution.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get Filmora Toolkit, Install It, And Run It</strong></p><p>To begin your editing experience with Filmora, first, visit the official website and download the most recent version of Wondershare Filmora.

However, do you realize that you can use speech-to-text technology in PowerPoint? Yes! It is effortless and fun-filled: dictate, and create presentable slides with your speech. What is more fun than speaking and seeing your speech in electronic formats? This article teaches how you can create presentations via speech-to-text technology and how you can use real-time translation in PowerPoint.</p><p><strong>Best Speech-To-Text Software</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text to make perfect PPT videos.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-enable-speech-to-text-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 1: How to enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint?</h2><p>Using speech-to-text in PowerPoint is the same principle guiding other platforms like Microsoft Words. Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915825/19272" target="_top" id="1915825">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915825" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915825/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint. However, you may need some tweaking on PowerPoint to finally use the feature as you prepare your slides.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Windows"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Windows</strong></h3><p>Aside from the regular Cortana speech recognition on Windows, you can use the speech-to-text feature on PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports “speech-to-text” when you use the program; however, activating the Windows device through the <strong>built-in speech recognition</strong> makes the process easy and effective. Some windows PC, just like Mac, lets you first activate the speech recognition function before you proceed and use it on PowerPoint.</p><ul><li>On PowerPoint, click on the microphone icon on the left corner of your PowerPoint’s homepage. If the speech-to-text feature is not activated on your device, you can follow the instruction to activate it. Peradventure you do not have PowerPoint installed on your device, you can activate the dictation feature through the command button or search feature on windows.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-3.jpg"                      alt="click on the microphone icon"                ></p><ul><li>Click on the search button and type <strong>“dictation”</strong> or “<strong>speech services</strong>,” and the device redirects you to settings. Here, you activate the dictation button as the Mac option explained earlier. You may also press <strong>“windows key + H”</strong> to start the dictation option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-4.jpg"                      alt="click on the search button"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-do-I-dictate-PowerPoint-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-do-I-dictate-PowerPoint-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How do I dictate PowerPoint for Mac?"></a>Part 2: How do I dictate PowerPoint for Mac?</h2><p>It is easy to use PowerPoint on a Mac after activating the <strong>“dictation”</strong> button.</p><h3 id="Add-speak-to-the-quick-access-toolbar"><a href="#Add-speak-to-the-quick-access-toolbar" class="headerlink" title="Add speak to the quick access toolbar"></a><strong>Add speak to the quick access toolbar</strong></h3><ul><li>Sign in to the PowerPoint on your Mac device, and locate the customized <strong>quick access toolbar.</strong> The quick access toolbar includes <strong>“more commands”</strong> and other options.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-5.jpg"                      alt="more commands and other options"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Reselect the option to “<strong>all commands</strong>.” The “all commands” should be enabled because they include many other commands, but you may not activate the options without selecting them.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-6.jpg"                      alt="reselect the option"                ></p><ul><li>From “all commands,” locate the speak option and add the option.

There are cases you need to activate speech-to-text in a life event. PowerPoint supports this through the “speech-to-text” feature available on the platform.</p><h3 id="Set-up-captions-and-subtitles"><a href="#Set-up-captions-and-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Set up captions and subtitles"></a><strong>Set up captions and subtitles</strong></h3><p>Real-time display and translation are suitable for the multi-language purpose. You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora version 13.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make PPT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027190/19272" target="_top" id="2027190">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027190" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027190/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation"><a href="#Use-Filmora-STT-to-make-PowerPoint-videos-translation" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation"></a>Use Filmora STT to make PowerPoint videos translation</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

For most people, it is the latter, which is why short Tiktok or Instagram videos with peppy background music get so much engagement. Faster songs bring out the energy and are memorable and passionate.</p><p>So, if you are editing videos you want to use for advertising products, a tutorial video, or a fun edit, speeding up the audio should help you. You can use an excellent <strong>audio speed changer</strong> to properly increase the sound speed of different songs quickly, without quality loss or cracking during the playback.</p><p>Multiple useful options are available in the market that promises high-quality audio speed adjustment functions. In this post, we shall look into apps and software with this function on mobile devices and desktops, discussing their features and how to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/10-best-apps-to-speed-audio-speed-on-mobile-0.jpg"                      alt="tiktok music"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-10-Apps-for-Audio-Speed-Changing-in-Android-and-iOS-Devices"><a href="#Best-10-Apps-for-Audio-Speed-Changing-in-Android-and-iOS-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Best 10 Apps for Audio Speed Changing in Android and iOS Devices"></a>Best 10 Apps for Audio Speed Changing in Android and iOS Devices</h2><p>Different currently available apps are operable on mobile devices and can effectively support high-quality speed adjustment settings for videos. These apps come with mechanisms that increase the speed of the sound without affecting pitch heavily.</p><p>Some apps require payment to operate better quality audio adjustment and other editing features.

These encoders usually come in variable size ranges as portable boxes, smaller units or larger permanent type fixtures; all of them have different capabilities.</p><p> The hardware type encoders are usually heavily priced and recommended for professional broadcasters. This category of encoders’ offers fixed video quality and users cannot make additional adjustments for its parameters. Hardware encoders demand much time for designing process as well as at development stage; you may often find few with older hardware components installed inside.</p><p> It is not possible to get a hardware encoder for free but they can be collected at low price tag. Many advanced encoders are priced below $100 whereas few highly professional designs are costlier. Note that, as hardware encoders have fixed set of arrangements to perform encoding process so they perform with higher speed as compared to software based encoders.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Top-Live-Streaming-Hardware-Encoders"><a href="#Top-Live-Streaming-Hardware-Encoders" class="headerlink" title="Top Live Streaming Hardware Encoders"></a>Top Live Streaming Hardware Encoders</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049382/7443" target="_top" id="2049382">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049382" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049382/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-VidiU"><a href="#1-VidiU" class="headerlink" title="1.

Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.</p><p>That said, when it is said <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>, it practically means that you are learning the process of blurring the background so the main subject (a person or an object) gets the most attention, and that’s what is explained in the following sections.</p><p>There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones. Likewise, if you already have an image, you can use the Photos app’s built-in effects, or download a third-party program to get the job done. Some of the common methods in this context are described below.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Take a Photo with a Blurred Background</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Add Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</h2><p>Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models. However, if you are using iPhone SE 2020 or iPhone XR, you can blur the background of the images only with the people as the main subject.</p><p>You can learn <strong>how to blur an image on iPhone</strong> using Portrait mode by following the instructions given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch the Camera App</strong></p><p>Grab your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustration), and tab the <strong>Camera</strong> icon from the Home screen to launch the app.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Get to the Portrait Mode and Adjust the Depth</strong></p><p>Swipe-drag the modes present above the <strong>Shutter</strong> button to switch to the <strong>PORTRAIT</strong> option, and tap the main subject on the screen that you want to capture the image of.

You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Camera App</strong></p><p>Use the method explained above to launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the <strong>PHOTO</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Turn on Auto Focus</strong></p><p>Tap and hold the main subject on the screen until the <strong>AE&#x2F;AF Lock</strong> message shows up at the top to confirm that the <strong>Auto Focus</strong> feature has been turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-auto-focus-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="iphone auto focus blur photo background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Capture and Access the Image</strong></p><p>Get closer to the subject.

However, to get this done, it is recommended that the main subject should be at the center so the background looks unimportant. You can follow the steps given below to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> with the Vignette effect:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Photo’s Edit Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPhone, go to the album with the target photo, and tap to open the target photo.

Furthermore, since such programs are designed specifically for the purpose, they are quite intuitive and come with self-explanatory options and buttons.</p><p>There is a plethora of apps available on the App Store that can help you get the job done, and most of them come with their free tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>. One such program is Snapseed that offers an easy way to pick the main subject in the image, and blur all the background objects behind it. The process of blurring the picture with Snapseed is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add the Target Photo to Snapseed</strong></p><p>After <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619" >installing Snapseed from the App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, launch the program, and tap anywhere on the main screen. On the accessibility allowance box, tap <strong>Select Photos</strong>, tap to select the target photo from your iPhone, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner. Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Take a Photo with a Blurred Background</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Add Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-the-Photo-Background-with-Portrait-Mode-on-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone"></a>Part 1: How to Blur the Photo Background with Portrait Mode on iPhone</h2><p>Portrait mode in the Camera app is available on iPhone 7 Plus and above models.

To access, you can either tap the <strong>Preview</strong> icon from the bottom-left corner, or get to the <strong>Photos</strong> app from the Home screen, go to <strong>Albums</strong>, and access the captured photo from the <strong>Recents</strong> album.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-photo-background-iphone-portrait-mode.jpg"                      alt="blur photo background iphone portrait mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Take-a-Photo-with-a-Blurred-Background-on-Older-iPhones-by-Getting-Closer-to-the-Subject-3"><a href="#Part-2-Take-a-Photo-with-a-Blurred-Background-on-Older-iPhones-by-Getting-Closer-to-the-Subject-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject"></a>Part 2: Take a Photo with a Blurred Background on Older iPhones by Getting Closer to the Subject</h2><p>If you are using an older model of iPhone that doesn’t have ‘Portrait’ mode, you can still capture the images with the blurred background by getting closer to the subject, and enabling ‘Auto Focus’ before tapping the ‘Capture’ button. You can learn how to do this by following the steps given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Camera App</strong></p><p>Use the method explained above to launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone. Because it’s an old model that doesn’t have Portrait mode, you can stay in the <strong>PHOTO</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Turn on Auto Focus</strong></p><p>Tap and hold the main subject on the screen until the <strong>AE&#x2F;AF Lock</strong> message shows up at the top to confirm that the <strong>Auto Focus</strong> feature has been turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-auto-focus-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="iphone auto focus blur photo background"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Capture and Access the Image</strong></p><p>Get closer to the subject. Ensure that the background around the main subject gets blurry and you move forward. Tap the <strong>Capture</strong> icon once you are close enough to get the desired level of blurriness in the background. Now, use the method explained above to access the captured photo.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Adding-Vignette-Effect-to-Photo-to-Blur-the-Background-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-3-Adding-Vignette-Effect-to-Photo-to-Blur-the-Background-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Adding Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background on iPhone"></a>Part 3: Adding Vignette Effect to Photo to Blur the Background on iPhone</h2><p>The built-in Photos app comes with the Vignette effect that can be applied to the image at the time of editing. However, to get this done, it is recommended that the main subject should be at the center so the background looks unimportant. You can follow the steps given below to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> with the Vignette effect:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the Photo’s Edit Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPhone, go to the album with the target photo, and tap to open the target photo. Next, make sure that the picture is not open in the full-screen mode, and tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the top-right corner to get to the <strong>Edit</strong> mode.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply and Adjust the Vignette Effect</strong></p><p>Tap the Effects icon from the bottom, swipe left to horizontally scroll through the available effects to get to <strong>VIGNETTE</strong>, and use the slider under it to manage the intensity to <strong>blur picture iPhone</strong> has.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-picture-on-iphone-with-vignette-effect.jpg"                      alt="blur picture on iphone with vignette effect"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Save and Access the Photo</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>Done</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the changes and to exit the <strong>Edit</strong> mode. Continue using the image as and&#x2F;or where needed.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps-3"><a href="#Part-4-Blur-the-Background-of-Photos-on-iPhone-with-Apps-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps"></a>Part 4: Blur the Background of Photos on iPhone with Apps</h2><p>You may want to use a third-party app to apply effects to the photos because they offer several advanced features that the iPhone’s built-in Photos app doesn’t. Furthermore, since such programs are designed specifically for the purpose, they are quite intuitive and come with self-explanatory options and buttons.</p><p>There is a plethora of apps available on the App Store that can help you get the job done, and most of them come with their free tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>. One such program is Snapseed that offers an easy way to pick the main subject in the image, and blur all the background objects behind it. The process of blurring the picture with Snapseed is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add the Target Photo to Snapseed</strong></p><p>After <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619" >installing Snapseed from the App Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, launch the program, and tap anywhere on the main screen. On the accessibility allowance box, tap <strong>Select Photos</strong>, tap to select the target photo from your iPhone, and tap <strong>Done</strong> from the top-right corner. Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-accelerating-ar-development-leveraging-custom-luts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Accelerating AR Development Leveraging Custom LUTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-efficiently-setting-up-mixer-on-macos/"><u>[New] Efficiently Setting Up Mixer on MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-game-streaming-tool-analysis-choose-obs-or-shadowplay-for-2024/"><u>[New] Game Streaming Tool Analysis Choose OBS or ShadowPlay for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pro-gear-bundle-elevating-your-experience-with-yi-4k/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pro Gear Bundle Elevating Your Experience with YI 4K</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-smartest-3d-apps-available-on-android/"><u>[New] In 2024, Smartest 3D Apps Available on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-navigating-echo-reduction-techniques-in-audacity-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating Echo Reduction Techniques in Audacity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-gopro-cinematography-luts-15-best-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to GoPro Cinematography LUTs (15 Best) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevating-your-images-with-words-step-by-step-guide-for-adding-text-on-pcmac/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevating Your Images with Words Step-by-Step Guide for Adding Text on PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-demystifying-the-digital-canvas-a-complete-guide-to-beginners-chroma-keying/"><u>[Updated] Demystifying the Digital Canvas A Complete Guide to Beginner's Chroma Keying</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-featuring-the-newest-tiktok-rappers-to-watch-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Featuring the Newest TikTok Rappers to Watch for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-access-unlimited-12-stream-livestream-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Access Unlimited 12-Stream Livestream Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-prime-resources-for-text-style-adjustment-files/"><u>[Updated] Prime Resources for Text Style Adjustment Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/10-free-location-spoofers-to-fake-gps-location-on-your-vivo-y78-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>10 Free Location Spoofers to Fake GPS Location on your Vivo Y78 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capture-and-edit-like-a-pro-with-these-8-top-montage-apps/"><u>2024 Approved Capture and Edit Like a Pro with These 8 Top Montage Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-comparisons.techidaily.com/comment-resoudre-les-problemes-douverture-de-fichiersdossiers-sur-le-bureau-avec-windows-10/"><u>Comment Résoudre Les Problèmes D'Ouverture De Fichiers/Dossiers Sur Le Bureau Avec Windows 10 ?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/essential-top-5-ultra-light-video-capturers-guide/"><u>Essential Top 5 Ultra-Light Video Capturers Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-color-calibration-transitioning-from-traditional-rgb-to-srgb/"><u>In 2024, Color Calibration Transitioning From Traditional Rgb to Srgb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fix-oem-unlock-missing-on-nubia-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Fix OEM Unlock Missing on Nubia?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/revamped-resolution-and-performance-tweaks-for-windows-11/"><u>Revamped: Resolution & Performance Tweaks for Windows 11</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you’ll have to purchase call credits. Overall, it’s a decent app, although better alternatives exist.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call"><a href="#Part-2-Best-real-time-alternatives-to-Magic-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call"></a>Part 2: Best real-time alternatives to Magic Call</h2><p>To avoid the troubles that come with Magic Call, here are some highly rated alternatives to consider:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082530/7443" target="_top" id="2082530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App"><a href="#1-Prank-Call-Voice-Changer-App" class="headerlink" title="1.

The intuitive design of TikTok makes it addictive to its users and the simple user interface helps them create video content more conveniently. Thus, TikTok can be called a video editor as well as a social media platform for its global users.</p><p>And one of the main functions of any video editing application is that the user should be able to zoom into videos to showcase specific areas of the video or to make a unique transition. In this article, we are going to learn about face zoom TikTok and how one user can use the Zoom function and make videos with it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video"></a>Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video</h2><p>With its growing popularity, TikTok has been adding many features to its video editing front. And one of such major functions of TikTok is to zoom the video as per your preference. There are two ways in which a user can zoom the video on TikTok.</p><p>The first one involves zooming in while recording the video and the second one is when you are editing it. And while creating a new video, you are needed to pinch into the screen to zoom your video to zoom in and you can pinch out to do a zoom out. The complete stepwise process is explained below:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and click on the plus “+” icon that will help you to create a new video. This plus icon is placed at the bottom of the TikTok interface.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-new-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="create a new video tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>When you tap on the “+” icon, the recording interface will open up. Now, select the duration of the video by tapping the “clock” icon on the left-hand side of the screen. After selecting a set duration, you will find a red shutter button which you will need to hold to start the recording.</li><li>Now, to zoom in on the recording, you can use any of two methods of zooming in. The first method involves you moving your finger up towards the top of your phone from the shutter icon. This will show you a red circle getting bigger.</li><li>Alternatively, you can use one finger to pinch into the screen while holding the shutter icon with another finger and this will ultimately help you achieve a zoom effect on your video.</li><li>For zooming out, you can move your finger towards the shutter button or pinch out and then save the video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Zoom an existing TikTok video</h2><p>TikTok is known to provide a vast number of filters as well as editing tools that can create stunning videos with very less effort. And the zoom effect is one of such important functions of video making. If you are new to this then you should know that either you can apply a zoom while creating the video or after recording it. So, for any reason, if you forgot to apply zoom in or zoom out while recording, then you can easily apply this effect while editing it.
