Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler.

Here’s a quick list.</p><ul><li>The right camera(s)</li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Tripods for camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>A camera light</li><li>3 way lighting (at the very least; you can use multiple lighting setups as well)</li><li>Shotgun microphones</li><li>Boom mic setup with pole and shock mount</li><li>Audio cables and recorder(s)</li><li>XLR cables (audio cables)</li><li>Headphones (so you can adjust sound levels more accurately)</li><li>Extra batteries, memory cards, and other equipment, so your gear doesn’t die while you’re filming.</li></ul><p>You may also need other materials if you’re working in a particular environment.

Most of the time, artists have some sort of idea as to what their main concept will be in the video, and who they want to work with. Otherwise, the record label will be in charge of such things. In general, this depends on the song being recorded and what sort of budget is being worked with.</p><p>On average, it takes around <strong>two weeks</strong> to get everything recorded and ready to go; it could take longer on the front end and back end when it comes to organizing and scheduling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-unlock-iphones-full-video-loop-potential/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unlock iPhone's Full Video Loop Potential</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-video-workflow-youtube-to-mpeg-essentials/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Video Workflow YouTube-to-MPEG Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-extract-gif-content-seamlessly-on-various-devices/"><u>[Updated] How To Extract GIF Content Seamlessly on Various Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-iphone-photography-fundamentals-the-essential-10-arrangement-rules/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, IPhone Photography Fundamentals The Essential 10 Arrangement Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-real-world-usability-of-photoshops-motion-reduction/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Real-World Usability of Photoshop’s Motion Reduction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-myth-busting-realities-of-instagram-story-followers/"><u>2024 Approved Myth-Busting Realities of Instagram Story Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-smoothing-iphone-pics-4-methods/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Smoothing iPhone Pics (4 Methods)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/expert-techniques-for-smooth-screen-casting/"><u>Expert Techniques for Smooth Screen Casting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-lava-yuva-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Lava Yuva 2 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-of-transferring-messages-from-poco-x5-pro-to-iphone-1415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Tips of Transferring Messages from Poco X5 Pro to iPhone 14/15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/inject-audio-harmony-to-premiere-pro-videos/"><u>Inject Audio Harmony to Premiere Pro Videos</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In this article, we discuss that further.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Dolby-Vision-HDR-Video-in-iPhone-12-or-13" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13"></a>Part 1: What is Dolby Vision HDR Video in iPhone 12 or 13</h2><p>Before we start discussing how to fix the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> problem at hand, one should understand what Dolby Vision HDR means in the first place. To note, it is a proprietary type of HDR format, with more data than SDR videos. This is because the camera quality with HDR effect can capture video recordings with extra data regarding the scenes, like shadows, highlights, and color range.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolby Vision type of <strong>HDR video iPhone 12</strong> feature works with dynamic metadata, which is useful for tone-mapping images in frame-to-frame or scene-by-scene format. The iPhone 12 devices allow the user to shoot high-quality Dolby Vision HDR videos in 4K, at 30-60 FPS. That is possible with the support of extra RAM in these device models and the presence of the A14 Bionic system-on-chip. Not to mention, iPhone 12 models come with a 10-bit OLED display.</p><p>Such factors make the demand for Dolby Vision <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> settings reasonable. However, the Dolby Vision quality only works on the most compatible devices with relevant display types. At this point, iPhone 12 is the only phone with this feature in the camera, which limits the ability to share 10-bit HDR videos to other devices or platforms, like Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Having HDR-based video playing in the SDR display type would automatically make the colors look weird and washed out. If the software came with an SDR squash functionality for importing&#x2F;exporting Dolby Vision HDR videos in SDR format, that would benefit users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed"><a href="#Part-2-Why-the-HDR-videos-on-iPhone-look-washed-out-or-overexposed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?"></a>Part 2: Why the HDR videos on iPhone look washed out or overexposed?</h2><p>It is inaccurate to assume that the <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> issues like overexposure or washed-out appearance occur due to Adobe Premiere not supporting Dolby HDR. On the other hand, the more reasonable reason is that most of the screens and system versions do not work with this functionality.</p><p>So, even if you use the Premiere Pro software and import exact images with accurate color composition and resolution, the image quality might look bad on most devices. If a monitor supports the HDR quality and you choose the relevant color space, overexposure issues will be limited.</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to click the video with the <strong>HDR video camera</strong> and display it on the right platform&#x2F;screen. In Premiere Pro, the Override into Rec.709 solution is available and can work to rectify this issue for some users.</p><p>With the right features like Color Workspace, Lumetri pre-sets, and other features, you can add them in a drag-and-drop manner to work on the project pane for more customizations.</p><p>The Premiere Pro 2022 version can work with the video clips as HDR after changing specific CM settings. The right monitoring setup must be prepared while working on this editing environment.</p><p>Also, it is important to consider the nits’ levels on screens to understand if a device can even display the <strong>iPhone 12 HDR video.</strong> These devices support a 10-bit OLED display type that can reach a peak brightness of 1200 nits. So, it is suitable to showcase the footage without much error.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Most-Effective-4-Ways-to-Fix-Overexposed-iPhone-HDR-video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: Most Effective 4 Ways to Fix Overexposed iPhone HDR video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>The following are some of the feasible solutions we’ve gathered, you can take to handle the overexposure quality of HDR videos while using Premiere Pro.</p><h3 id="Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR"><a href="#Solution-1-Turn-Off-HDR-or-Export-them-without-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR"></a>Solution 1: Turn Off HDR or Export them without HDR</h3><p>One of the easiest methods to avoid issues with <strong>iPhone HDR video</strong> is to switch off the HDR setting directly.

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software. Finally, remember that the list contains free and paid programs you can use for your creative work.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">PhotoDirector 365</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">XnView Classic</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">IrfanView Graphic Viewer</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">WidsMob Viewer Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Image Glass</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Free Video Editor to Make Slideshow with Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice"><a href="#Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?"></a>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2.

For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds.

How can you switch from photo viewer for Windows 10 to your preferred software?</h4><p>Access the <strong>Default Apps</strong> menu from the <strong>Settings</strong> option of your OS. Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?</p><p>First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive.

Oh yes, and you need a little bit of imagination as well. That’s all there is to it.</p><p>After you get the program, install it and follow the step-by-step instructions you’ll see below.</p><p>Also, there are plenty of different ways to create 3D text effects in Adobe Illustrator. This tutorial will focus on explaining the easiest and quickest one. Just know that this doesn’t mean the result will be wrong. Most methods yield the same results.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-3D-Text-Effects-in-Adobe-Illustrator"><a href="#How-to-Create-3D-Text-Effects-in-Adobe-Illustrator" class="headerlink" title="How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator"></a>How to Create 3D Text Effects in Adobe Illustrator</h2><p>Now that you know what you’re getting into, let’s finally reveal the entire process. Just follow the steps and do as you see here.</p><p>Step1 Open the program and start a new project.</p><p>Step2 Click on the <strong>Type tool</strong> and click anywhere on your blank canvas. Then, type in your text—type in anything you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-type-tool.png"                      alt="type tool illustrator"                ></p><p>Step3 Now, look at the bottom-right corner of the program. Find the <strong>Font</strong> settings and change your font type and size to anything you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-font.png"                      alt="change font illustrator"                ></p><p>Step4 Next, choose any color you want for your text from the panel on the screen’s left side. Just remember to click on your text first before you start changing colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-color.png"                      alt="change color"                ></p><p>Step5 Align the text to make it easier to edit and move around the canvas later. Just click on it and then click on the three buttons in the image below. This section is located at the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-align.png"                      alt="align text in illustrator"                ></p><p>Step6 Up next, you need to turn on your 3D Effects panel if it still needs to be activated. To do this, click on <strong>Window</strong> → <strong>3D and Materials.</strong> Then, look at the right side of the screen, and you will see the panel pop up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-3d-materials-window.png"                      alt="turn on three d panel"                ></p><p>Step7 Click on the box icon on the right side of the screen and select <strong>“Extrude”</strong> This will instantly transform your text into a 3D model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-panel.png"                      alt="turn text into three d"                ></p><p>Step8 Now, all left to do is experiment with the settings in this panel and adjust how you want your 3D text to look. You can adjust its width, rotation, presets, angle, perspective, and so on. Just play around with the settings until you find your ideal result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-illustrator-settings.png"                      alt="three d illustrator settings"                ></p><p>Step9 Finally, it’s time to export the image, and you’re all done.</p><h2 id="Best-Alternative-Way-to-Create-3D-Text-Animation"><a href="#Best-Alternative-Way-to-Create-3D-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Best Alternative Way to Create 3D Text Animation"></a>Best Alternative Way to Create 3D Text Animation</h2><p>You might not believe it, but there’s an even more accessible and less expensive way to create 3D text effects.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Expert’s-Picks-The-Best-10-Photography-Lenses"><a href="#Expert’s-Picks-The-Best-10-Photography-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Expert’s Picks: The Best 10 Photography Lenses"></a>Expert’s Picks: The Best 10 Photography Lenses</h2><p>One of the first creative choices made during the photographic process is choosing a camera lens. There are a seemingly limitless number of alternatives available, and your decision will have a significant impact on your photos. The introduction of mirrorless prompted the demand for lenses that matched the new formats.</p><p>Initially, while manufacturers like Canon, Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony expanded their line of native lenses for those formats, photographers were dependent on adapters to fit legacy lenses from brands like Canon and Nikon to the APS-C, full-frame, and micro four-thirds mirrorless cameras. Additionally, independent lens producers like Sigma and Tamron continue to be crucial in supplying the demands of photographers looking for the greatest camera lens. Let’s start off!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens"><a href="#1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens" class="headerlink" title="1. What should you look for when buying a lens?"></a>1. What should you look for when buying a lens?</h2><p>There are a number of factors to think about while looking for the best camera lens. Knowing how you’ll use the lens is just as crucial as ensuring sure it’s available and compatible with your camera’s mount (or that an adapter is available). Are you trying to find the best portrait lens? Or perhaps you’re looking for the best lens for landscape photography. Or maybe you prefer taking pictures of little objects, in which case you’ll need a macro lens. There are (nearly) universal, all-encompassing circumstances, of course. Just keep in mind that neither the greatest lens for landscape photography nor the finest lens for astrophotography will inevitably be the ideal choice for macro photography.</p><p>Regardless of the lens you select, the effective focal length’s relationship to the sensor size is a crucial consideration. Because the sensor on full-frame cameras is the same size as a 35mm film strip, this is not a problem. However, you must consider the crop factor if you’re using an APS-C or micro four thirds camera. A 100mm lens will provide a field of view of 150mm when used with an APS-C camera, which will crop the frame by 1.5x or 1.6x (depending on the model) (35mm equivalent). It simply captures a smaller portion of the image produced by the lens, giving the impression that the image is zoomed in. The effective focal length will double with a micro four thirds sensor, giving a 100mm lens a 200mm (35mm equivalent) field of view. This is typically not an issue with telephoto lenses because you want a larger focal length, but it’s crucial to keep in mind with wide-angle lenses so make sure to conduct some calculations before choosing one.</p><p>The cost of a camera lens is affected by some aspects. A lens with a quicker (lower f-number) maximum aperture will cost more than one with f&#x2F;stops that start with a slower maximum aperture, such f&#x2F;3.5. For longer, heavier lenses, optical image stabilization—also known as SteadyShot, vibration reduction, or simply OIS or OS—is crucial. Invisible elements like the caliber of the glass, the kinds of coatings used on the surfaces, and the weather sealing are also important.</p><p>In the absence of other factors, some minor extras like the presence of a lens hood, a manual aperture ring, a carrying case, and other bonuses may influence your decision. but shouldn’t determine the outcome of your decision.</p><h2 id="2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses"><a href="#2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses" class="headerlink" title="2. What are some good and robust lenses?"></a>2. What are some good and robust lenses?</h2><p>Focal length is one of the most important factors for picking the best camera lens and producing a nice photo while taking portraits of individuals or even very small groups. Generally speaking, a short telephoto lens is good, especially for tight compositions (headshots, waist level&#x2F;head and shoulders, etc.)—an 85mm or 105mm, for instance. If you can’t back up and shoot wide, you might want to go as wide as 70mm or 50mm for full-body and larger group images in order to minimize distortion.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S"></a><strong>Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S</strong></h3><p>The premium Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S lens, made for full-frame Nikon Z-series cameras, offers superb edge-to-edge sharpness for landscape photography. The aspherical lenses on the small lens are perfect for maintaining the sharpness of stars and city lights. Additionally, there are two ways to install filters: a slot for filter sheets and gels at the back and 112mm filters that may be screwed into the front.</p><p>Other choices for ultra-wide-angle lenses for full-frame cameras include the Sony FE 12-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 G Master. This camera lens is intriguing, albeit expensive, because it offers a little extra coverage starting at 12mm and maintains a consistent aperture throughout the zoom.</p><p>The 14–24mm f&#x2F;2.8 art series lens from Sigma is available in two variations. One is for DSLRs from Canon or Nikon, while the other is for mirrorless cameras from Sony and L-mount.</p><h3 id="Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8 is the first lens up, a costly manual focus prime lens with a small but devoted fan base. The only true bells and whistles this lens has are the “Zeiss” moniker, and I’m sure many photographers wonder if it lives up to the $1843 price tag in any other manner.</p><p>I must admit that I would never purchase this lens for myself, but to me, it does. Nevertheless, it is one of the sharpest wide angles I’ve ever tested, and unlike many of the other lenses on this list, it accepts filters (82mm size).</p><h3 id="Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3"><a href="#Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3"></a><strong>Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3</strong></h3><p>This 60-600mm super telephoto zoom is perfect for wildlife since it is wide enough to capture visitors to the bird feeder outside your back door or a pod of dolphins surfing the bow waves of a boat while still being long enough to capture the most elusive lioness and her pups on a picture safari. This image-stabilized lens, which is offered for Nikon, Canon, and Sigma, includes a tripod collar and is dust- and splash-proof.</p><p>The Sony FE 200-600mm f&#x2F;5.6 has Sony’s outstanding SteadyShot image stabilization, making it a great lens for Sony photographers. Although we typically advise zooms for wildlife photography, don’t discount some of the primes available. For instance, Canon’s EOS R mirrorless system is compatible with the Canon RF600mm f&#x2F;11 IS STM lens. Even though it only has an f&#x2F;11 maximum aperture, it should still function properly in well-lit environments.</p><p>Although you might need to increase the ISO to obtain a quick shutter speed, this lens is less expensive than other extreme telephoto lenses.</p><h3 id="Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4"><a href="#Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4" class="headerlink" title="Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4"></a><strong>Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4</strong></h3><p>For a couple reasons, I chose the lesser-known Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 lens over the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8. First, it costs half as much ($800) and is substantially lighter (719 vs. 1170 grams). These two elements alone make this lens more appealing to many photographers.</p><p>Second, the Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 has outstanding image quality. When I used it, I didn’t get a chance to directly compare it to the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, but I did evaluate how it performed when I photographed the Milky Way, which is likely the most demanding scenario. I accomplished this by comparing it to four other top 14mm lenses. With virtually no coma and perfect sharpness even when wide open, it defeated all of them.</p><p>This is a fantastic option for shooting landscapes in addition to stars. Although it lacks autofocus, the 14mm focal length makes it either the best or second-best lens on our list in terms of image quality. And once more, the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, which is the closest rival in that sense, is twice as expensive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2135475/26400" target="_top" id="2135475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2135475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135475/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8 is one of my favorite wide-angle lenses that I’ve ever used. Although it is weighty, the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 matches or even outperforms it in terms of overall image quality. It also comes with some contemporary features, such as vibration reduction and a front element that repels water. The telephoto range is where it loses some strength, like the Nikon (see our review), but even there it performs better than others.</p><p>The pricing is the actual incentive to get this lens instead. Additionally, there is a previous model with nearly comparable image quality that is available for even better used pricing. It costs $1200 new and even less used.</p><p>Tamron lenses don’t extend all the way to 14mm (closer to 15.5mm instead). Although the increase in focal length to 30mm is good, we believe that most of this lens’ potential customers would be more interested in the wide end of things. Additionally, similar to the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8, it doesn’t come with built-in filter support, so if that’s crucial to your photography, you’ll need a hefty attachment.</p><h3 id="Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4"><a href="#Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4"></a><strong>Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4</strong></h3><p>This lens is a recent addition to our list, and several people have asked why I didn’t include it in the comments. I’ve only lately had a chance to really test the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4, and I think it’s a great lens. First of all, it offers an excellent price of $600 and excellent image quality.</p><p>It is lightweight and has an f&#x2F;2.8 maximum aperture, making it ideal for astrophotography. This all comes together to provide a pretty remarkable package. In spite of the fact that corner sharpness isn’t nearly as good as it could be compared to certain other lenses on this list, the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4 doesn’t really have many drawbacks to speak about. But that’s hardly a criticism of this lens. It’s one of the first I’d look at if I needed a wide-angle zoom for a Nikon.</p><h3 id="Nikon-20mm-f-1-8"><a href="#Nikon-20mm-f-1-8" class="headerlink" title="Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8"></a><strong>Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8</strong></h3><p>It is sharper than all of the zooms on this list at 20mm, with the possible exception of the 14-30mm f&#x2F;4. And assuming you don’t require the 14mm focal length for your Milky Way work, it’s better than practically every lens above for astrophotography thanks to its f&#x2F;1.8 aperture.</p><h2 id="3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime"><a href="#3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime" class="headerlink" title="3. What lenses are good for nighttime?"></a>3. What lenses are good for nighttime?</h2><p>Most photographers find nighttime photography challenging because this particular shooting circumstance frequently depends on your lens’ capacity to pick up light. abundant light As a result, investing in the ideal equipment that makes the most of any available ambient light and illuminates your entire frame is essential for success.</p><p>Here is our list on the top nighttime camera lenses to help you capture the darkest of scenes.</p><h3 id="Canon-EF-24-70mm-f-2-8L-II-USM"><a href="#Canon-EF-24-70mm-f-2-8L-II-USM" class="headerlink" title="Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM"></a><strong>Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM</strong></h3><p>For general photography, one of the greatest lenses is the Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM. This has an excellent build quality and a quick f&#x2F;2.8 aperture, which are its biggest advantages.</p><p>This focus range, also known as the “walk-around lens,” may be used to shoot whatever you could possibly want, including tight portraits and landscapes. The f&#x2F;1.8 lenses that we described at the beginning of this post are one stop slower than f&#x2F;2.8. However, the Canon 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II has a number of qualities that make it a fantastic lens for shooting in low light.</p><h3 id="Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens"><a href="#Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens"></a><strong>Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens</strong></h3><p>Amazing glass is the Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens. With a maximum aperture of f&#x2F;1.2, the widest an autofocusing lens can go, it offers excellent results. Since the lens includes a floating mechanism, focusing up close as well as throughout the remainder of the focusing range will be simple.</p><p>One “F” Low Dispersion Element, also known as a FLD element, and four Super-Low Dispersion glass elements make up the lens. This substance functions very similarly to a fluorite coating. There are also two spherical components. Together, these components make sure that chromatic aberration and distortion are minimized in the lens.</p><p>The lens also features a Super-Multi-Layer coating on top of it. This reduces flares and ghosting while enhancing the image’s sharpness and saturation. The Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.4 DG HSM Art lens is available for DSLR cameras, although it is only available for mirrorless systems.</p><h3 id="Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens"><a href="#Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens"></a><strong>Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens</strong></h3><p>The Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens is the last item on our list, but surely not the least! The G-Master is your best pal if you own a Sony mirrorless camera. The most expensive lenses you can purchase directly from Sony are in their GM range, which includes the well-liked Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens.</p><p>This lens’s wide focal length and fantastic f&#x2F;1.8 aperture make it a handy tool for astrophotography. Edge-to- edge sharpness means that the stars you photograph in the corners of the frame will be just as sharp as those that appear in the center of the picture.</p><p>Sharpness is second nature to this GM lens. Neon fringing can be prevented from occurring in the areas of your image that are contrasted by having good chromatic aberration management. This one feels quite cozy in your palm because to the ergonomic lens design.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-Nikkor-50mm-f-1-8D"><a href="#Nikon-AF-Nikkor-50mm-f-1-8D" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8D"></a><strong>Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8D</strong></h3><p>Among Nikonians, the Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 F-mount lens is a perennial favorite. This 50mm prime lens has an f&#x2F;1.8 maximum wide aperture. The lens has an aperture ring, a focus distance indication, and a manual focus ring.Flares and ghosting are handled by the lens’ Super Integrated Coating. The 50mm is versatile since it has a physical ring that regulates the aperture and a manual focusing ring.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123480/16836" target="_top" id="2123480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123480/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-What-are-good-micro-lenses"><a href="#4-What-are-good-micro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="4.

Macro lenses provide close-ups and magnification that would not be feasible without their specialized optical design, opening up a wide range of photographic opportunities for teeny-tiny plants and animals</p><p>Additionally, macro lenses aren’t just useful for this; they also make great prime lenses in general and work especially well for portrait photography.

Ring- type ultrasonic autofocus and a three-position autofocus limiter switch, which can shut off the short or long end of the range, are typical high-end attractions.</p><p>The lens also contains an Ultra-low Dispersion element and weather sealing. Even at f&#x2F;22, image quality is superb throughout the whole aperture range, allowing you to squeeze out a bit extra depth of field. For the majority of macro photography, the manual focus ring is more crucial than the autofocus since it is smooth and precise.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2121331/18498" target="_top" id="2121331">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2121331" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2121331/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro"><a href="#Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro" class="headerlink" title="Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro"></a><strong>Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro</strong></h3><p>The AT-X PRO 100mm macro lens from Tokina was introduced back in 2006. In 2019, the replacement atx-i (interactive) model hit the market with a new design that gives the lens a more modern appearance. However, appearances can be deceiving, because the newcomer uses the same optical path with two aspherical and two Super-Low Dispersion glass elements as the original.</p><p>The fact that only the Canon mount version includes an autofocus motor and that it has an expanding inner barrel that extends longer at closer focusing distances are other similarities. The image quality is excellent, with outstanding sharpness levels, little distortion, and barely detectable lateral chromatic aberration.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S"></a><strong>Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S</strong></h3><p>One of two new Z-mount macro lenses is the MC 105mm from Nikon. There is also the more affordable Z MC 50mm f&#x2F;2.8, which is a good lens, but the MC 105mm has a better macro photography focal length and is a pro-grade lens, so it’s well worth the extra money.</p><p>A super-fast and very accurate autofocus mechanism, together with highly effective optical VR (Vibration Reduction) that can function in conjunction with the in - body stabilizers of Nikon’s full-frame Z-series cameras, provide sublime image quality for both general shooting and extreme close-ups. A multi-function OLED display, a lens-function button and control ring that can be customized, an autofocus range limiter, as well as an electronically connected focus ring that permits ultra-fine adjustments, are all features of the handling exotica camera.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro"><a href="#Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro"></a><strong>Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro</strong></h3><p>This is Nikon’s top-tier FX format macro lens, yet it also works well with DX cameras when photographing up close. It has a ring-type ultrasonic autofocus mechanism with entirely internal focusing, 3-stop VR II stabilization, and Nano Crystal coating, just like the 85mm DX lens in the group. The optical pathways of both lenses have 14 elements total, including one ED element.</p><p>The 105mm has a greater diameter because FX format lenses must produce a larger image circle to cover the larger picture sensor. At the minimum focus setting, the working distance between the front of the lens and the subject is fairly similar to the DX lens at 14.5cm. Similar to the Sigma lens, the VR system is effective for usual shooting, although it performs less well for close-up shots than the hybrid stabilizers from Tamron and Canon.</p><h2 id="5-What-are-the-price-ranges"><a href="#5-What-are-the-price-ranges" class="headerlink" title="5.

You ought to purchase professional lenses if your money permits. Pro lenses are the most expensive, offer the highest level of image quality, and frequently have the largest maximum lens apertures.

Due to the continuous popularity of utilizing a “real” camera with interchangeable lenses, you undoubtedly have many options nowadays.</p><p>Another query arises after taking a look at these new camera lens prices. Is it a smart idea to think about used camera lenses instead of brand-new ones. I’ve learned that it’s a smart idea to take used lenses into account as well.

There are so many software tools available onpne to complete this task and <a class="link"   href="https://www.pscp.tv/" >Periscope <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the easier platforms out of this big pst. It assists users to pve stream their content directly from phone. Using Periscope, you can easily stay connected with whole world and can have continuous updates about what is happening around. The best thing to know about Periscope is that it works perfectly on Android as well as iOS platform.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Pros-of-Periscope"><a href="#Pros-of-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Pros of Periscope"></a>Pros of Periscope</h2><p> 1. One of the biggest benefits of Periscope pve streaming tool is its super simple and highly intuitive design that makes everything easier for novice users. Simply download your apppcation and start broadcasting with one cpck access.</p><p> 2. You need not to mess with setup, complex wirings and there is no need to access any speciapzed equipment as well as coding is not required. Simply plug and start playing.</p><p> 3. You will be glad to know that Periscope is available for free with all impressive features.</p><p> 4. When you find opportunity to work on streaming apps that are popular, it naturally makes your sessions more interactive. Periscope app is well recognised among pve streamers and a large community is connected to it. Instead of just staying dependent upon advertisements or brand management, this apppcation has something unique to offer with more authentic content.</p><p> 5. When you start setting your pve broadcasting video title then you can also choose active share options to send it on Twitter platform, make some easy settings about who is allowed to comment on your videos and users can also activate the location information. This active location sharing mode allows users to find viewers from nearby locapty and hence more interactions can be boosted.</p><p> 6. Periscope also provides abipty to save the broadcasts so that they can be easily accessed in near future. Over most of platforms, the work on your broadcast pst gets automatically removed after 24 hours but Periscope value your efforts and give you opportunity to save your creative content.</p><h2 id="Cons-of-Periscope"><a href="#Cons-of-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Periscope"></a>Cons of Periscope</h2><p> 1. As we already discussed, this apppcation is too simple, being an advantage on one side for beginners, it is also the biggest con for professionals. This extremely simple platform lacks in advanced settings and becomes restricted to casual use only. It cannot satisfy needs of demanding users.</p><p> 2. When we talk about pve streaming then it is pke a business, many streamers make huge money from their channels but this option is not accessible with Periscope because it does not allow monetization. It does not entertain pay per view type sales, ads or any kind of subscriptions and it leads to major drawback if you consider your streaming career as a business.</p><p> 3. This apppcation provides very pmited functionapty for pve streaming. As per default settings, everything stays pubpc whereas the only control option is to ban users for once or allow broadcast sharing with targeted audience.</p><p> 4. If you are searching for followers then it is really very difficult to know whether user is onpne or not. You cannot even get information about whether these profiles are active or are unresponsive from long time.</p><p> 5. It does not allow interaction for broadcast downloads, that is really sad.</p><p> 6. The only interaction supported by Periscope is with twitter platform, it does not allow users to share content on other popular social media platforms.</p><p> 7. Periscope is too much caring about its branding; users need to be inside app in order to watch the stream or to upload a pve stream. That means most of the major aspects are under the control of apppcation and users need to follow them. Users cannot even adjust the colour streams for their broadcasts.</p><p> 8.
