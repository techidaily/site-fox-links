Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic"><a href="#2-Italic" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough"><a href="#3-Strikethrough" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace"><a href="#4-Monospace" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages"                ></p><h4 id="8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See"><a href="#8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See"></a>8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See</h4><p>If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg"                      alt="Mute Whatsapp Stories"                ></p><h4 id="9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group"><a href="#9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group" class="headerlink" title="9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group"></a>9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group</h4><p>This is as simple as it sounds. Tap and hold to select a message in a group and then open the 3-dot button at the top right to access the feature.</p><h4 id="10-Customize-Notifications-for-Specific-Contacts"><a href="#10-Customize-Notifications-for-Specific-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts"></a>10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts</h4><p>Manage how you are notified of messages from specific contacts and groups. Go to the main page of the contact or group you wish to customize, and there you will find Custom Notifications. Activate the mode to open a wide range of options - notification tones, pop up, preview, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-custom-notification.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Custom Notification"                ></p><p>Source: beebom.com</p><h2 id="Edit-WhatsApp-Videos-with-Ease"><a href="#Edit-WhatsApp-Videos-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease"></a>Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</h2><p>Some of the best WhatsApp video editing tricks are coming up, wherein you can add doodles, text, and crop an image.

Once you have the Video, you can import it to Filmora and use a gamut of video editing tools to create the magic!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Record-Video-Calls-from-PC-and-Improve-Its-Quality"><a href="#2-Record-Video-Calls-from-PC-and-Improve-Its-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.Record Video Calls from PC and Improve Its Quality"></a>2.Record Video Calls from PC and Improve Its Quality</h4><p>For this WhatsApp Video Editing Trick, you would need to have a third-party screen recorder tool, like Wondershare Filmora on your PCs, and the iPhone 11 has one in-built software for screen recording.

Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal.

It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast" class="headerlink" title="4.

What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show"></a>Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify"></a>Tip 2. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title. Doing your research will save you time and hassle.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1"><a href="#Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”"></a>Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”</h3><p>Another goal in boosting or promoting your channel would be to make a channel name that is simple and easy to pronounce. Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot"></a>Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot</h3><p>As a podcast is an audio medium, your name should be easy to pronounce. You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it. A lot.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Get-feedback-from-your-network-1"><a href="#Tip-5-Get-feedback-from-your-network-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5. Get feedback from your network"></a>Tip 5. Get feedback from your network</h3><p>Generating a name for a podcast is not an easy job. However, you can also get feedback from your network. For example, you are gathering suggestions from your friends or teammates. If your podcast has already got some followers, you can ask the audience for advice and let them comment below the podcast.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down. It is all about originality.</p><h3 id="2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1"><a href="#2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Should I name my podcast my name?"></a>2. Should I name my podcast my name?</h3><p>There’s nothing wrong with naming your podcast with your name as long as it is unique and stands out. You cannot simply name your podcast, i.e., “<strong>Joe Rogan</strong>.” Instead, your podcast can include your name creatively, such as, i.e., <strong>“The Joe Rogan Experience.”</strong></p><h3 id="3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1"><a href="#3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can someone steal my podcast name?"></a>3. Can someone steal my podcast name?</h3><p>If your podcast is in its early stages, you may encounter some accounts pretending to be your channel. Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Should I rename my podcast?"></a>4. Should I rename my podcast?</h3><p>You can do that in the early stages of your show’s growth. But as your audience grows, changing the channel’s name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.</p><p>Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light. Your goal should be to choose a Podcast name that is unique from the beginning and work on growing it to its</p><p>best potential.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-superior-viewing-experience-essentials-of-4k-downloading/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Superior Viewing Experience Essentials of 4K Downloading</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-perfect-harmony-how-to-add-audio-content-in-adobe-premiere/"><u>[New] Perfect Harmony How To Add Audio Content in Adobe Premiere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-asmrs-upside-exploring-its-health-impacts/"><u>[Updated] ASMR's Upside Exploring Its Health Impacts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-gaining-exposure-cost-effective-promotion-hacks-for-youtubers/"><u>[Updated] Gaining Exposure Cost-Effective Promotion Hacks for YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unparalleled-excitement-top-10-adventure-classics/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unparalleled Excitement Top 10 Adventure Classics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-hubsan-h501s-x4-fpv-quadcopter-review/"><u>2024 Approved Hubsan H501S X4 FPV Quadcopter Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/building-a-better-movie-utilizing-windows-11s-movie-maker/"><u>Building a Better Movie Utilizing Windows 11'S Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-with-imei-code-on-apple-iphone-15-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On Apple iPhone 15</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-detect-and-remove-spyware-on-motorola-g54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Detect and Remove Spyware on Motorola G54 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/iphone-screen-capture-simplified-guide-for-2024/"><u>IPhone Screen Capture Simplified Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://dvd-bd.techidaily.com/ps5-dvd-compatibility-and-guide-to-watching-movies-on-your-console/"><u>PS5 DVD Compatibility & Guide to Watching Movies on Your Console</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/shift-your-screenscape-dynamic-windows-11-backgrounds-for-2024/"><u>Shift Your Screenscape Dynamic Windows 11 Backgrounds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/syncopated-mix-management-in-sonar-by-platinum/"><u>Syncopated Mix Management in Sonar by Platinum</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Remove BG"></a>2. Remove BG</h4><p>Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3.

The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4.

The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6.

While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7.

Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Visionary-Tools-Free-Environmental-Props"><a href="#Visionary-Tools-Free-Environmental-Props" class="headerlink" title="Visionary Tools: Free Environmental Props"></a>Visionary Tools: Free Environmental Props</h2><p>Videography and filmmaking require manipulative techniques to make things look real and captivating. Among the tools or techniques applicable in achieving this is a “green screen” in filmmaking. A green screen is the actualizing backbone of sci-fi movies and other related scenes in a movie. Green screen is likely the tool used in making the impossible possible in most of the movies you have seen in the past. The green screen works by imitating an easy and straight act of editing and manipulating originally recorded scenes. Some <strong>green screen templates are free</strong>; you do not need to learn video manipulation before you use <strong>green screen templates</strong> in filmmaking.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Green-Screen-templates"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Green-Screen-templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Green Screen (templates)"></a>Part 1: What is Green Screen (templates)</h2><p>The green screen is the underlying background for post-production effects in video making. Cinematography has developed: advanced technology is applicable in editing and customizing effects via “computer-generated imagery” (CGI). The CGI is the main tool facilitating video manipulation; however, the green screen is the aiding factor. CGI is not possible without green-screen effects. And this is why green screen templates are inevitable for all video makers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/green_screen.jpg"                      alt="green screen"                ></p><p>Green screen templates are ready-made effects free for use and downloadable. Unlike advanced videography, green screen templates do not require installation or a combination of software. You can use green-screen effects even from Filmora: an online video and image facilitating website.</p><p>Advantages of green screen templates include easy application, smooth editing, beginner-friendly, and cost-efficiency. A simple video editing costs a reasonable amount and effort; however, using a green screen template reduces cost and time. Many green screen templates are free on the web; learning about individual green screen templates and their unique feature improves productivity.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-use-green-screen-templates-on-your-videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-use-green-screen-templates-on-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to use green screen templates on your videos"></a>Part 2: How to use green screen templates on your videos</h2><p>Green screen templates are available on reliable sources (for example, Filmora); you can create your green background yourself. The best way to use green screen templates is to apply ready-made templates on a platform; however, there are conditions where the right green template you want is unavailable. In this case, you must create the green screen video yourself.</p><h3 id="2-1-Download-green-screen-templates"><a href="#2-1-Download-green-screen-templates" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Download green screen templates"></a>2.1 Download green screen templates</h3><p>Downloading a suitable green screen template is the first thing to do. Ensure the green screen template fits the original video you want to overlay. Visit a template source, search “green screen” from the search space and select the right video that best represents your need&#x2F;original video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmstock_green_screen.jpg"                      alt="filmstock green screen image"                ></p><p>You skip shooting the green background video yourself if you use a template. However, the ready-made video template may reduce quality production if you do not use the right green screen template. Keep the movement and element in mind while selecting a green screen template for your project: ensure the speed&#x2F;movement aligns with the original video elements.</p><h3 id="2-2-Import-the-video-background-and-green-screen-videos"><a href="#2-2-Import-the-video-background-and-green-screen-videos" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Import the video background and green screen videos"></a>2.2 Import the video background and green screen videos</h3><p>Import the two videos on Filmora: background and green screen; the background video replaces the green screen video.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive.

However, the requirements and evaluation standards you employ when selecting a cloud provider will be particular to your business. So, any service provider evaluation will often concentrate on a few critical criteria.</p><p><strong>1. Authorities and Standards</strong></p><p>The adherence to industry best practices and standards is demonstrated by providers who follow recognized standards and quality frameworks. Measures can be pretty valuable for narrowing down the pool of potential suppliers, even though they might not ultimately influence which service provider you select.</p><p><strong>2. Locking of Cloud Data</strong></p><p>It is reasonable to worry about becoming bound to a specific cloud vendor. As <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> become increasingly popular and affordable, more applications support the most widely used cloud services. Thus, seeking applications adopting a multi-cloud data strategy is advisable to guarantee that freedom. There are now multi-cloud data management tools that enable clients to select between avoiding cloud vendor lock-in and application separation from specific cloud storage providers.</p><p><strong>3. Access Cost and Speed</strong></p><p>Organizations must consider two key aspects of data access to cloud services: speed and affordability. Understanding cloud storage providers’ service-level agreements (SLAs) is essential for speed. Generally speaking, the storage business can loosen its guarantees regarding access speed the more affordable the storage is. This is especially true for cloud archive storage, which costs very little, where the SLA for data access is expressed in hours.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs"></a>Part 4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free"><a href="#1-How-can-I-get-100GB-for-free" class="headerlink" title="1.

Microsoft Teams, a platform for corporate collaboration, is part of the Microsoft 365 family of products. Teams provides file storage, application integration, workplace chat, and videoconferencing. Microsoft’s existing workplace communications and collaboration solutions, notably Skype for Business and Microsoft Classroom, will be replaced by Teams. With that in mind, we’ve compiled this guide to explain How to Zoom in Teams among the other features that would be helpful as a Team user.</p><p>Through Teams, users may talk with one another. Users do not need to check a discussion history since conversations on Teams are permanent, in contrast to Skype for Business. In conversations, users may format text and include emoticons. The user may designate a communication as urgent or important. Communications regarded as important have a red symbol. Along with real-time communications, Teams users may collaborate on documents. Microsoft has a considerable competitive edge over competitors as you can learn How to Zoom out in Microsoft Teams. Follow the guide below to learn how to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-microsoft-teams.jpg"                      alt="zoom microsoft teams"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Way-to-Zoom-in-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams"></a>Part 1: Best Way to Zoom in Teams</h2><p>By visiting a certain online address or receiving an invitation from the team administrator, communities, organizations, or teams may join Teams. Using teams for education, administrators and instructors may designate specific teams for classrooms, professional learning communities, and staff members. Due to all the aforementioned services, a system is needed to comprehend all that team members communicate via teams. Therefore, zooming in is a crucial tool for accurately reading or seeing a crucial document or brochure.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Zoom-in-on-Microsoft-Teams"><a href="#Steps-to-Zoom-in-on-Microsoft-Teams" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Zoom in on Microsoft Teams:"></a><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Microsoft Teams:</strong></h3><p>The process for zooming in on Microsoft teams is now quite straightforward. The only difference is whether iOS or Windows is being used. With the Windows operating system, just use the keyboard to zoom in. You merely need to be aware of the right keyboard shortcut to zoom in on the Microsoft Teams UI.</p><p>Step1Open Microsoft Teams and start a new meeting. Click on the profile icon and choose Settings from the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-teams-settings.jpg"                      alt="microsoft teams settings"                ></p><p>Step2To zoom in, use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+&#x3D;.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-teams-screen.jpg"                      alt="zoom in teams screen"                ></p><p>Step3Press the Ctrl+0 keyboard shortcut to restore the zoom in Microsoft Teams.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Zooming-in-Microsoft-Teams-Using-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-Zooming-in-Microsoft-Teams-Using-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Zooming in Microsoft Teams Using Camera"></a>Part 2: Zooming in Microsoft Teams Using Camera</h2><p>Microsoft Teams acts as the focal point for workplace interactions, collaborative effort, video conferencing, and document sharing as a collaborative workspace inside Microsoft. The goal of this group of technologies is to raise employee productivity. On-screen zooming and camera zooming for meetings are the two types of zoom functionality that Microsoft Teams users are most interested in. The user interface can be zoomed in since it is natively supported, however the camera cannot be zoomed in without the use of third-party software.</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Teams does not provide native camera controls. A camera-controlling app with zoom-in&#x2F;zoom-out features would be necessary. You may try YouCam for that. YouCam Perfect’s new image-enhancing features enable you to create magazine-quality portraits from your selfies. The program comes in two versions, one of which is free and the other is a paid version.</p><p>YouCam is a program intended to control and use webcams. The webcam or any other camera that is linked to the computer may be accessed by this program, which is highly powerful. The free version comes with the basic zoom in&#x2F;out capabilities, but it also has sceneries, emoticons, and filters. Other unique features of the YouCam Perfect program include an immediate beautifier, a tool to improve skin tone, a physique enhancer, a collage builder, and a social network as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/youcam-zoom-camera.jpg"                      alt="youcam zoom camera"                ></p><h3 id="Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam"><a href="#Steps-to-Zoom-in-Teams-Using-YouCam" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:"></a><strong>Steps to Zoom in Teams Using YouCam:</strong></h3><p>The process to enabling CyberLink YouCam will vary depending on the sort of instant messaging program you are using.
